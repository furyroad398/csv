Phase
Now that’s nice
I want a gran turismo 7 version please
thats awesome
Oooh cool!!!
Wow. That’s beautiful.
Totally Awesome..need more PS5 Themes..
Sick
All games design are suit for PS5 Smiling face with heart-shaped eyes
I wonder if someone made a fan made PS5 Bloodborne Edition!
I like
Very nice but the original one its nice
That design is too Fire
I want this
Gorgeous
I find it so funny (in the best possible way) that a guy named XboxPope is absolutely killing it with PS5 designs. They all look incredible
Now it looks like a dirty suit
Awesome!!
Take my money
Too goodRed heart Crying face
"Yikes almost thought this was real, it's awesome"
:(
"Am I the only one who gets caught out thinking the Horizon ""H"" looks like one of those single person Aeroplanes??"
It looks awesome Smiling face with sunglasses
This is beautiful
I will murder an entire species to get one of these
Eh
Nice pope you are the best
I’m a fan of Popes work and a HUGE fan of Horizon. Not a fan of this design tho.
I like the console itself but not really the controller
I thought this was official for a moment
That's hard no. It looks like grass of war with that claw marks
"Oh, wow. I want this."
"doesnt really match the theme of ps5. Ps5 looks modern but the colour just changed it whole completely. Just do black, white and spiderman"
That thing is so clean that its dirty
I’m drawn to this.
"going to be honest, I don't like this one. Doesn't scream Horizon to me."
Omg that’s awesome
It fits the theme of the game.  Well done
That’s amazing. I honestly thought it was destiny at first
Oh my
Beautiful Beyond imagination
Terrible imo
If only just
"All these cool designs just show that Xbox and Sony really should be offering specials console for ALL major releases, and skins for the 		rest of them."
Holy
Dooooooo IT!
Can you actually buy this? Face with tears of joySmiling face with heart-shaped eyes
Nice
All this wasted marketing potential from @Sony is really sad. It looks so awesome.
When will they announce the proce guys plz tell me
2 weeks
Now make one for xbox
Ps5 Exclusive
Looks sweet doesn't it! Love it if they actually made one like that
This looks like a Jurassic World custom PS5 lol Should've included the focus and a tallneck or something This is generic af aside from the logo
Or you could do your own and share it with everyone
I wouldn’t mind seeing you design and create just that and share with us all
"Look's pretty cool, but I would prefer one that is designed after the Focus! I'm not usually a big fan of the console skins that look 		""weathered"""
you will never please everyone but maybe understand the game a bit more and it will all make sense
"It has a nice grungy, left on earth for so many years, decompose look to it; only true artists would understand."
"You somehow managed to make the worlds ugliest console, look 1000 times worse"
That ugly yo
The phrase 'polishing a turd' springs to mind.
That looks so shit
"Not feeling this one, maybe some red from the virus infecting the planet would look nicer."
Looks dirty
I don't like the miss look
"Hello, do you make hentai designs?"
Wow. Did you find it near the horizon
Lol..honestly looks like the only colors that would look good with that design is the original and all black
Now THAT is an xbox fans interpretation of a PS5 if ever I saw one Face vomiting
yes
"All these custom designs look expensive. Yall need to temper your expectations, its most likely gonna be a simple logo on the white frame 		and rarely ever gonna be a full custom design. The craziest it ever gets is the actual color changing. Microsoft is the one with crazy 		designs"
Just sounds like an Xbox fanboy trying to swap people over. Shut up
It looks nice! But when I saw a custom ps5 was made by xbox pope I just had to think for a sec
Sony did mention customization. I wonder are the outer covers really swappable.
Meh. Yes and no. Thumbs upThumbs down
"wow, how do you even worsen the original console design.."
This looks as bad as anything else he makes.
Is this strictly just for show or will it be possible to get something like this?
I think the god of war version the colors don't look very well
maybe a bronzeish gold will look good? I'm just imagining it and it seems like a better choice
What would a horizon zero dawn one look like
This is the best one I've seen yet. That looks incredible.
Hell ya
Dope!!!
Love the Spider-Man DualSense
Dude I just had an orgasm looking at the KH one
Omg yes
Death stranding pls
I love these
Dope
Yes
That spider man one looks legit.
I want God of war plz lol
Take my money
I love the Spider-Man Controller.
I want the kingdom hearts one Pleading face
That GOW one looks too soft idk.
But wheres the destiny one?!
İ like death strandig style
oh wow the one with spiderman is legit!!
Garbooo
Totally would pay double for that kh one
I will be highly upset if all these mock ups don’t come to life.
That Death Stranding and GoW ones are badass!!
I’ll have mine in camouflage or black please
Please make the spider man and god of war controllers....stop teasing not cool!
"I dig the Spider-Man one, but I feel color combos like this will prevent me from buying too many different colors, I'll probably end up with 		2 or 3 different ones but 2 or 3 each. As opposed to 7 or 8 different colors."
Sweet!!!!!!
god of war all day
dead stranding is nice...
I’d nut on these
That spiderman one tho
Spiderman controller looks like mario
Sony has a money maker just with the controllers they look and can be absolutely amazing...
There's a Yakuza ps5 controller 2 .
These custom controller edits are so good
Sexy
Where’s the gta one
Wow I want the spider-man one
Y'all acting like Sony is into custom controllers like Microsoft. Don't get your hopes high.. they don't care about this at all
GoW and Kingdom Hearts is dope
Who made this?! I’m going to make a video and I need to credit the source lol
God of War version needs more blood
Batman
Please make a Goku one Smiling face with heart-shaped eyes
Nah...
The spider-man controller is the only one that redeems this.
People who own pc rgb keyboards and mouse make fun of Playstation  players for having creativity
Spider-man Controller
It looks good but useless
Why can't we keep with the classic model this looks bulky and stupid
Batman please ?? Heyyyyyy
Spiderman all day!
I think it could be better
"Me too, it could be better if it has been white and black and also with the figure of Ellie and Joel on the sides of the controller"
wow
Too soon! The game was just delayed! It still hurts.
"Screw this, give us the game alread"
"I have never played the game, but I love the colours"
Yoooo i would so cop this
beautiful
Don't like black. Can't see anything on it that would make me want to buy it
I might have more remotes than games the next time around
Awesome!!!
Reminds me more or a Zelda or even masterchief skin but my eyes be different from others. Still feel like there could be more added to this
That is 1 ugly controller
I am copping that
Nah
20 minutes of battery
Too much and the button colors are ewww
That's actually a really cool concept but there should be an option to turn on or off the lights.
As cool as that looks that battery life would not last long
EVERYTHING WONT LAST LONG IVE BEEN SAYING THIS FOR YEARS NOBODY LISTENS SWEARRR!!!
5 minutes of battery
This would be next level.
This is how it will most likely work cause the square triangle etc  buttons need colors.
No sleep???
"Really cool, but say goodbye to your battery life"
I think you will be able to turn it off
"This is false,  ive removed the light bar function from a controller and its battery length isnt noticeably different. Its the vibration that drains the hardest."
YOOO THAT WOULD BE SO COOL
No it won't drain that fast. LEDs are not power hungry.
Thought you’d love to see this. Would be sick!
does look sick tbf
I actually believe that at least the buttons will light up. If not then Sony will be facing some backlash in a time where accessibility is in big focus.
How would the buttons lighting up make the controller more accessible?
Woah
Battery killer
And the Church say AMEN
Don’t tease use like that. That’s a beauty! Sony could pull that off easily!
Yeeeeeees please
Holy smokes Face screaming in fear
Yooo @PlayStation please
It's so gorgeous!
Just pls have this happen
sa fresh ouh
That would be dope
It’s not to late @PlayStation
Ps5 controller looks the ps4 controller but suffered a break up and decided to reinvent itself
Looks cool but it will drain the battery life like crazy.
Sooooo good
Oof
Would be cool but that battery life would be non existent.
"Thats sick( i mean,in a good way)"
Sick
Yes Smiling face with heart-shaped eyes
Yah that be dope af if they lit up. I'm hoping they do. Looks awesome.
waow
Oh the buttons will absolutely light up!
Does it tho? You should know.
RIP Battery
Holyyyyy
Battery life would be like 1 hour lmao
The battery life would be horrible
Too many lights will look cheap
That would be fucking awesome
Damn.. Not gonna lie that's pretty sexy lol
#NAME?
Imagine if this was real
Imagine that shit reflecting off the tv. Quality product right there lol
That would be lit
Lights can be added but to animate like this would increase the cost of controller.
Looks like it will drain a battery in a hour
"I'd get one, but only one."
YOOO THIS  HEAT
make it happen
Very cool. But I don’t think I want a light show shining up at my chin while playing in a dark room.
But I thought they were trying to improve battery life? All that lighting would drain it like crazy.
Plz @PlayStation make this happen
The battery already lasts 10 mins. This will make it last 5
It's not cause sony is lazy at coming up with designs
I just wish it wasnt white
Welp there goes my battery
My nephews would never touch it
damn
I just busted
Dope
This is actually how it works until I see otherwise from Sony.
Need for speed underground
The most beautiful control in all times
Would be awesome....but the battery life would be 7 minutes lol
Yo no cap but this shit might just be the lit controller ever Quite literally Face with tears of joy
Led light required more batteries energy
Wow I Love It! That looks Next Gen
Yeah it looks cool but I rather have a better battery performance
gaystation
Banana I'd puke of happiness
OMG
Battery would last 15 mins
nice if they use same touchpad light but refect it to light buttons using reflective plastic. so no extra lights needed.
I hear the whole system is 5g compatible
I’m assuming it will
If you do that it will be incredible
This is like HTML CSS JQuery and Javascript in a PS5 now that gave me an idea. It looks so amazing that controller.
Looks like a quantum suit to mee
"As cool as that is, i don't want to sacrifice battery life for all those lights"
Excellent work
I think it looks good
That would be amazing Smiling Also... $200
It's supposed to be like a Tron Theme! Hence the noises and color pattern
It should just be the Touch Bar animation...
this would be so cool if this becomes reality!
Then the battery would last like 5 seconds between charges
Do it!
The light up buttons are little much for me
That a alot if battery being drained
Battery first
Nobody would look at a controller while playing anyways
I actually have a third party PS4 controller that does to an extent. Always the favorite one at party's.
PS5 has Fortnite?
Ok...this officially HAS to be added to the controller if it isn't already!! This would be hellishly awesome
Amazing bloody cool
This DuelSense Controller is Fire Period
please and thank you
i want you
I'd absolutely lose my sh*t
I hope it looks like that looks awesome
oooo man
Its growing on me lol
"They already said the battery life will be better, so I wouldn't mind this being true"
just imagine
I wish also do you have any intel on the price cause i wanna know how much to save up
That would be awesome but also horrific for battery life
"I really dont like the new gen of controllers... they look to future and I honestly think that everyone just likes the modern styles of controllers, like when your getting your nostalgia from playing some bo1 or 2 you've got this futuristic controller which doesn't even look good"
Hey thats the best thing i ever seen Make it like that sony
Prophetic
"No, just no."
Cool but then the battery will die in 5 hours hahah
That would be AMAZING!
That is cool but I want the battery to last a lot longer this time around xD
I really think that
DualShock Star Wars edition
Goodbye battery life
THIS IS B.S
PLEASE!
HEAR ME OUT!!!!!!!
i want it to make the lights in the room turn off with the sequence too
Too cool !!!!!!
Sick... Loving those mockups
That's a little more cool
Would be dope as hell.
Cool cool
I hope it doesn’t Face with tears of joy the battery life is bad enough as is
is there a HD version of that video ? some1 gimmi a link
Really cool
ooffffffffffffffffffffff
If it did this controller would be $75 Face with tears of joy nobody gonna have time to buy that and a $60 game
That would be amazing
"With the option to turn it off, sure. You know someone gonna mod it like this for sure"
Battery would last for like an hour
5 minutes of battery
I hope and I strongly believe she will so beautiful
That would be bad More light= less battery time
"If it's responsive to the game in multiple ways, like flickering, then it will be worth the extra power consumption.Quality over Quantity"
Maybe without the d pad and button lights. That I'm happy with
That would be dope
I want Green
"Please,don't give me hope……"
This isn’t your hope the story is shot
That’s 3 days before my birthday!
actually，their Twitter background is just changed……
Hope this is true in any case
It’s true after the big leak. Everyone knows what happens
"Can't really hold it back now. The leaks sucked and the plot killed me, but I'll still play it because I loved the first. But man, ND went for the jugular with this one."
Seriously the only one that comes out winning is a rushed character that is a trans jacked up on super soldier juice
This is amazing! Is Ghost Of Tsushima staying at June 26th?
Nah it got pushed to July but it’s still this year
WHAT THE FUCK???? OH MY GOD???
Guys of any spoiler or photos block them
"Are you serious? The leak is all over the places, everybody knows what happens."
Dont play with my emotions
Doesn’t matter anyway
This... this can’t be real..
Yesssssssss
ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT
What!!
I so lost interest and forgot I followed this - until now
Yes
Yeah boy
Is it a digital release? Or will pre-orders ship? Anyone know?
My 39th  birthday present!
Beautiful even tho it’s should be may
I believe it if i hold the game in my hands
Well this game is ruined lets wait for cyberpunk and hope for the best
Oh thank God.If there was a God.
HELLO WHAT
LIES!!!!!
My birthday. It’s a sign.
Hopefully it’s for real this time.
Awesome
Hopefully it will be waiting to long I really want to play this game
Too bad the entire story got leaked and it's quite disappointing.
What?
"Just canceled my preorder! Will not have my favorite game ruined by political correct BS! If Joel dead, then for me, so is this Part II."
Been looking forward to this for years! Soooooooooooo glad I looked into the spoilers. Get woke go broke. Saved myself $99 aus. Good work Neil
The graphics are insane. Holy shit.
I think we know why they finally said it the whole story got leaked so they said fuck it lol
Guaranteed since that spoiler shit came out the story will be different now so who cares
"No THX i dont buy this again , Now i Wait half Price mby"
what?  it cancels my pre-order because they don't know the launch date of the game after all.  I prefer not to say.  it would not be beautiful !!!!! I'm sorry for my quality of English ....
who cares
Who cares about the spoilers you guys are effin baby’s the graphics are insane that’s all that matters and the length of the story like grow up
Games gonna lose everything that made the first one special just because it wants to push the sjw agenda.
Really hyped for this man
"Can't believe it, was going to get this for by Birthday since my holiday got cancelled. Now that's out the window. Today really sucks"
At least it was a very light delay
Legitimate question: why are people excited for this?
legitimate question: why do you care?
Watch the trailers on YouTube
That's okay
Leak a few clips and watch them move the dare forward
Can’t wait!!!
Kinda pissed cuz I already pre-ordered it
Great
Another month?? Ughhhh
I have been looking forward to this.
Can't wait for this game I'm so excited to play it
Not too bad it looks like it switched with TLOU2
huh
"Not too bad, at least it's this year lol"
PS only? Damn that sucks m8
Is this going to be the far cry primal of assassin's creed?
trailing missions all over again
It is just a title not a game related to assassin creed
"The Assassin's symbol is prominent this time around, so it would seem that it is."
There goes my hope for AC: Outlaw set in Robin Hood times...
"Everyone saw this coming, but I'll consume anything related to Vikings or Norse mythology, so you have my axe. I mean money...my money."
Hopefully it'll be good and we will see Vikings in Italy and eastern Europe as well a northern Europe and England
Wow wow wow
shiny and chrome?? Ahhh probably not
"I guess this was a logical next step, one of the few historical eras and cultures they haven't really visited in the games yet. I hope it's good!"
oh shit
"Going to say that I'm not a fan of this. If it's anything like Odyssey, it misses the point of the Assassin's Creed franchise, but that isn't to say it wouldn't stand on its own as an adventure RPG. The heavy dependant RPG aspects of Origin and Odyssey were not a good fit."
"I feel kind of the same but not. Like if its gonna be a viking game in the same Spirit of Odyssey, where It would have gotten alot less funding if It didnt arbitrarily had The AC name. Im happy It got The budget."
I will definitely be buying it.
Is it actually be an assassins creed game and not some wannabe rpg like odessey? AND have Assassins?
No kidding I want a actually assassins creed game
Reveal Then After Reveal Is The Release Date Which Is The Date For PS5 Mmmmmmmm
Amazing reveal. Congrats!
wants
Also white supremacy-ie. Or at least there is a risk people will say that when it comes out.
ASSASSIN CREED GHODI
Gonna be the first assassins creed i buy
Just like vinland saga
Can't wait! If it's anything as good as Odyssey it'll be amazing
I am so not a video game person but I greatly desire this.
I kinda forgot about assassins creed. If this game looks good I'll buy.
If it’s anything like odyssey I’m game.
im going to need some wallpapers for my desktop ASAP
Hardly BREAKING when the world has known the next game was going to be Valhalla for weeks!
Might be the first Assassin's game I get since Assassin's Creed 2
with ragnard
"Assassins Creed, one of the first games I truly luved."
"Nothing is true, everything is permitted"""
Better than call of duty
Yessssssssasaa
Can’t wait to slay those Swedes
I think we’re about to find out the vikings were surprisingly black and gay
Same shit different name
Same thing can be said about World of Warcraft
Mmmmmmmm
Called it
I bought the last ac because it was anchient Greece and thought it would be decent. That game was shit. Wont fool me again ubisoft.
These games are shitt!
danger hairs gonna be mad
I will only buy if I can have a boat like in black flag
why is there no ps5 logo at the end like in other game trailers they show all of them and PC but this is only xbox
"Its on the ubi store for pc,Xbox and PS4 from what I saw"
how geed does this look
Vikings? Looks epic. Aye a cant wait av still to complete the egyptian n greek one. U see last of us 2 is coming out? U should defo play it unreal
Ragnar Lothbrok is an Assassin!
The tv ratings are about to increase lol
"Now eventually you might have, uh, the creed in your Assassin's Creed game, right? Hello? Yes?"
"They’re gonna keep the creed in it as  keeps it as a recognizable name, and I’m fine with that"
"Can’t wait for the future, delayed til March 2021 announcement."
I'm gonna choose to believe it will release on time so I can be crushed when an inevitable delay is announced.
So this ISNT the Last Kingdom?
Looks incredible tho
The first next gen trailer has dropped
"I was just watching that lol, looks amazing"
Come on g
Movie or game??
The graphics are so very realistic!Smiling face with heart-shaped eyes this trailer is absolutely AMAZING!!!
lol this isnt gameplay this is just Cinematic trailer
Looking forward to it
Is it not coming 9n PS4 or one X?
Just checked it is coming to PS4 and one x
ps5 looks epic
I know I saw it this morning! Looks amazing
is it gonna come out for xbox one?
YEET
Nooooo! I need this on my ps4
Then there’s Twitter quality which destroys the trailer smh
Getting serious last kingdom vibes from this trailer
Really wish we could get this now... I’m out of games to play Face with tears of joyFace with tears of joyFace with tears of joy
"To coin a phrase, ""k."""
Looks good but they missed an opportunity to have wardruna or heilung as the trailer music. Something fitting with the time atleast.
Is it assassin creed anymore?
Yo that looks sick
What date is holiday 2020?
This is gonna be soooo epic!
Going to simp all over this
"Clearly, the developers are fans of the show #Vikings. Can't freaking wait for this!!!"
I'll wait to pre order that later on Xbox series X.
we can be a lady viking though right
Excited for Viking assassins but damn do they really not want to give us feudal Japan
Vikings vibes
THOSE GRAPHICS LOOK LIKE A MOVIE
Can’t the Series X play Xbox one games?
Can't wait this game
Where are the hoods?
Didn't really like odyssey but if the game mechanics in this game is different from odyssey I'll buy
I get kinda excited then I remember I'm not the biggest fan of the new RPG still of Assassin's Creed
Just pre ordered this beauty! Cannot wait
Yes please
This looks very good
Confirmed
Christmas wish list lol PS5
Shame it's all cinematics but gameplay on 7th may for series X which will pretty much be the same on ps5
When is Holiday 2020 like Christmas or the summer?
"Of course on the Series X, it will be marginally better."
When’s the game coming out?
Holiday 2020. As it says in the tweet
"This is lame! Not showing anything about Assassin's. Origins, Odyssey and Valhalla is shit"
The experience is only what you make up it. So if you’re hung up on dudes having to have hooded robes and knives on their wrists then keep carrying on and don’t appreciate innovation and trying new things Love-you gesture. FOR VALHALLA
Video was a bit underwhelming but it’s cool I guess
Are we getting co op?
Funny how you put ps5 before xbox lol Am sure xbox is getting it early
HOLY FUCK I NEED THIS
Right? Guess ima have to buy my dad a PlayStation 5 this Christmas
Yup I’ll be getting that
This doesn’t even look like an “assassin creed game” Face with cold sweat but fuck it I’ll give it a SHOT!!!
also gonna be xbox one right?
Yeah also on ps4
Will this use xbox smart delivery
Pls have something to do with the assassins and don’t be another Odyssey
And Origins was another Witcher III
What date is holiday 2020?
November usually. Could be December as well.
As long as it isn't like the Settlement building in Fallout 4
Will you get to choose your gender again?
"I feel like this is moving away from what assassins creed used to be. It used to be about being nimble, agile and sneaky but now it seems like the complete opposite. Vikings arent know as being any of those things. They’re know as being almost like tanks with heavy weapons"
I’m hyped about this game looks so good
I hope its multiplayer
Do you think they’ll make another assassin‘s creed multiplayer? Like the Black flag multiplayer or assassin‘s creed unity?
Just drop the Assassins Creed and name the games something else coz they are amazing games but calling them Assassins Creed you not doing them justice
Last one I played was Black Flag. Ill have to see gameplay
"""Grow Your Settlement"" So the home base stuff is back? Awesome! That was one of my fave mechanics of the older games."
Where did u get those images
Dual wield! And that morningstar is a beast
Not an assassin...
HELL YESSSSSS!!!
"Kinda looks like they took influence from God of War. So it's coming to PS and Xbox this holiday, but MS has marketing rights..."
I mean that’s exactly what I was waiting for
I really hope this game is good. In my opinion there hasn’t been a good assassin’s creed game since black flag. U guys pretty much do the same thing every year & don’t change up a thing. Odyssey was nothing new & very predictable. Innovation would be nice here
Why does this look like Elder Scrolls
Need to see more assassin stuff to be hyped
Dark Age Open World. Lead Raids. Pumped for this
Meh
This sounds amazing...
Is it not strange that we not getting any news on this no new gameplay or anything
I guess that they're pulling a far cry primal for the grow your settlement
New Trailer for Assassins Creed Valhalla out now
Downgraded graphics on consoles. That's a fact.
Not sure why you didn't just drop the AC title for Origins and Odyssey and start a different franchise. This is so far removed from the style of game that made the franchise brilliant. Massive open worlds with endless repetitive missions are boring.
In the trailer you see links being dismembered. Do we know if that was just CGI or an actual gameplay mechanic?
Vikings wore mail armor
Can someone please explain what is Visceral combat system? How is it diferrent from other combat systems?
"Not hyped yet, need more information and footage"
"Props Ubisoft for making this run on PS5, even with their weak ass teraflops."
Elden Ring for kids
"Grow your settlement? Fuck, not this shit again..."
Looks awful
That is twitter compression you should watch it on yt it looks awesome
Bruh I thought that was Atreus for a minute. I got hyped
You’re not the only one lol
Oh wow
Jesus christ no more unreal tech plz
this is crazy
Omg it looks so cool!!!!!
Nah it's a cinimatic trailer. It's not gonna play like this.
"I don’t see any engine, I see an animation which is good but not new on PlayStation, if what I just saw was an actual gameplay I would be surprised, otherwise you are just hyping for a video."
Unreal
Bro this stuff is awesome Game development is really going places
I just want to cry
You people should leave me ooo..  I stand with @unity3d
"Jesus, this looks so damn good."
Wow
look at that madafakir graphics dude
I saw bro and i'm so excited
Main reason for buying a ps5 over an Xbox are the exclusives.
the beauty
ON. MY. GOD.
wow
Very nice... for PlayStation owners.
to be honest it looks like a game on the ps4 pro
"Can't judge off of a twitter video. Also, its in the early stages, look at early gameplay of games on the ps4, it'll progress with time"
perfecttt
Oh snap
Is this real
Looks epic
smash
She’s serving
Damm might get both now FUCKKKKKKK
this should be a younger Faye before she meets Kratos.
"Wow looks sick, does this demo have a title?"
WOW
Anthem looked this good? I’m missing the hype?
So I can definitely see a huge improvement to ue4 but I wish this demo could've been like the ue4 demo that was a lot slower and took time to show you details. This moved way too fucking fast to appreciate it.
Wow amazing and awesome beautiful
have you seen this wow.
SO GOOD
"So good, watch it on the ign video on YouTube"
Go watch on YouTube
You’re welcome bro! I’ll have more donations for you when I can!!!
"not gameplay again by the looks of it, just like the xbox thing the other day."
insane
Looks awesome
People really thinks that Unreal Engine 5 is going to be used only in PS5
"this video doesn’t do any justice , y’all go look at it on youtube and have the video set to 1080p"
Awesome incredible and the graphics are excellent I thought it was a real person
Super cool
Oh dang
Now if only the games look as good as this
wow
Finally i can use my saving to buy PS3
This looks amazing
So Better engine
Gameplay demo needed
At 1st I taught it was Horizon then I taught it was some Stargate at the end lol
Not impressed. Can we skip 5 and get UE 6.
The xbox demos we've seen so far look very very average at best
I like the way the PS5 detects when you blink and loads in the next few hundred gigs of game.
Imagine what UE5 will look like on the PC.
WoW PS really out here running laps with there latest buisness moves.
Shit makes me want a PS5. Shame it won’t have Forza Horizon otherwise my pre order would be in now
Bro this looks fucking amazing.
Everything in that tech demo was running 100% real time and everything is original no hacks no light maps no normal maps no tricks
Everything is real
If people do not understand that then I know exactly why people say that they are just the same with UE4 even if they are not
Image What Series X Is Gonna Be Like
Game is this though?
I was hoping this was the next Prince of Persia oh well still made me double take sweet
Ps4 can do the same shit lol
This isnt gameplay. This looks like one of those teasers that gives me balls once we see the game play
So many triangles bro
Ok. Series X will destroy ur whatever system with halo infinite
"a kinematics holds up a lot, it's like paper. Let's see how it actually works"
is this tech demo a stargate game?
I mean I'm all for better graphics but I don't want it to look to real if that makes any sense
That’s cute
"This is so fucking cool, man!!!"
i wish i could fly like that.
"Greatest of all time, SONY PLAYSTATION. Living up to the extremely high expectations so far! Love to see it!"
"amazing, cant wait PS5"
Honestly I’m happy with my ps4 and Xbox one consoles im just going to invest in a custom gaming PC I’m sure I can have same or better graphics
I would love it if it was BUT I need to see someone actually demo it/ have a controller in hand. I dont believe its true ps5 tech demo
"It’s a shame that this is purely a tech demo and won’t come out as a full game, looks genuinely really interesting and cool"
Watch this in 4k monitor and upscaled to 4k quality. its awesome!
Awesome!!!
Goldeneye64 remastered
We need a reveal lol
"Imagine if they bring out the ps5 and it's literally slightly better graphics that's it Flushed face should be called PS4 pro, pro."
You guys know that this is a Tech demo not gameplay footage or anything close right... Just a quick poll anyone know of any games using or planning on using Unreal Engine 5?
Finally
Is this actually running off a ps5?
bro check this game trailer
What TV is that playing on? Sony 900H?
The graphics looks like ps3 graphics
Is it just me who thinks that sounds a lot like the voice actress for Tracer?
"Yes. 1440p, 30fps and no raytracing, on a demo that could be ran at higher specs on Series X and PC. Very impressive indeed."
"Magic wings, magic legs. There"
Is there a link to watch this somewhere else cuz twitter is ass
Man... what is this trash?
Where the fuck it says its on ps5
Pc is better and epic games store sucks
"The majority of people’s PCs aren’t better though. Keep lying to yourself. And best of all ,I guarantee you will pay twice as much money for a PC to get on par with a PS5. Good luck with that"
Shiiiiiitt
not gameplay tho
I don't mean to be negative but this is not impressive at all.
Silly people this has nothing to do with the ps5. They just used the ps platform to show off the new unreal engine. This is purely engine not ps 5. It will be the same or better on xbx and PC
That will be flying off the shelfs
this is not the ps5 demo this is the unreal engine 5 demo
"This video; poor in quality, show the shit in ultra 4k. Face with rolling eyes. That's the real shit."
Imagine what the Xbox is gonna look like
Too much sand
Exactly but watch the Xbox players look crazy when Ps5 sales are sold out
Omfg wow that’s crazy!
This is gorgeous
"How about knack 3, any news on that?"
They show (1) game for the playstation 5 and they say playstation have won
wtf is this shit game
I think it’s just a demo not really a game
pc turds know your place spat on and kicked out your platform is nothing of course turdboxseriesX is laughable i don't consider them even human GTFOH we own you
This engine will run best on PC.
What is unreal engine 5?
pretty impressive but let's see some real titles - tech demos aren't enough. You make Gran Turismo 8 with this tech and I'm there on launch day with $500 ready
stupid
does this mean ps5 is coming 2021?
No the engine will be available in 2021
Can’t she fly? Why is she walking?
THIS IS WHAT FORTNITE WILL BE RUNNING AT OMG DJJDJDJDBDGDH
OMG OMG I CANT WAIT OMGGGGG
PS>XBox
I thought it was coming for Christmas?!
PS5 is still coming 2020.the graphic engine is coming 2021
This crazy that gaming comin to this immediate cop
"Awesome,Amazing give me a PS5 right now!!!"
Are there any fights in this game
HOLYSHIT
Can you elaborate more
Dope!!!!!!
I couldn't tell you the difference between the ps4 and ps5 if i tried.
Looks amazing! This Gen system is going to be amazing just like the previous systems!
That looks ... AWESOME
It’s nothing great.Enviromwnts look great.But they still have that same player animation/movement we see in every character in every game.People don’t move the exact same or react the exact same.Why is it so in games?It would be nice to see some leaps forward in that aspect.
what the ps5 will look like
"Not a fan of unreal engine games, but that was definitely a nice tech demo for them!"
Lol
What's the Playstation 5 release date  ?
Can't wait to see how bad ass Minecraft will look!!!
This is insanneeeee. Who else can't wait for the PS5?!
I’m literally crying I’m so fucking happy
Xbox just got smoked only one game in
Yes yes yes.
I nutted
OMGGGHGG!!!
This is all I needed to see for me to get the mothaeffing console
IM SO HYPED OMG BUT HOPE TO PLAY WITH PETER THO
TAKE MY MONEY
Is this a dlc or full game?
Is it a new game or dlc?
Bro this is sooooooo crazy
IT'S WHAT HE DESERVES
I’ll be getting this launch title
Yes a black Spiderman
If it’s anything like Marvel’s Spider-Man a few years ago. Sign me up
And I was just finishing the dlc!
Another shit nothing unique in it for 60 $ .
Show us the goddamn console
PlayStation showing gameplay unlike Xbox
hell yes
Neat
Will they finally allow women to choose an avatar? I know a lot of women who love gaming and racing and it is a disappointment when they can't make the avatar look like they do.
YESSSSSS
I wonder if it will be as boring and repetitive as the first one
That looks crazy!!!
Is it a full stand alone game
Full game? Or what?!?
Awwww man don’t like him as a character
wanna buy 3 PS4?
this is gonna be so good can’t wait
so can someone help me on this. will we still be able to play as peter? or is it only miles this time around? and will peter/ spider man still be involved?
I’m hyped for this but kinda disappointed to I thought Spider-Man 2 was gonna be with venom
I feel like It’s a spin-off title. Hopefully if it is a full sequel you’ll be able to play as Peter too.
sick
Can we expect this to be on ps4?
Where is the new Batman game??
Don’t show me a trailer that won’t even have this video quality when it comes out
Buying this day one
I’m pretty sure this’ll be a stand-alone DLC type thing
Hey Mark does this mean new piderman vids?
Bruhhhh I’m too hyped Did you see horizon II
Fuuuuuck....I legit just got goosebumps. Thank you
Hyped does not even cover it
wow !!!
This seems to futuristic even for a superhero game
Truly amazing.
I can't wait!
Game actually looks sick
Soundtrack Fire
hope we could play as peter parker
This. Looks. Siiiiick
wow
YESSS
I don’t even play campaign games but this is a must cop
Y’all really gonna make me buy a PS5
Thank u Ps5 the spider man is Black not white
Morales... yeaaaaah!!!!
This was the best reveal i ever seen in my entire life i really cant breathe right now
Wow!!!!!!!!!!!!! I can’t wait to own this!!!
Will it be on PS4 too??
are u kidding me
IT’S ABOUT TO GO DOWN!!!
So no Peter in this one?
What happened to Peter?
PS5 just bought itself.
Yaaaaaass
Nice. I'm hyped.
Yaaaasssssssssss miles
i wanted this since i finished the first game
"Hell yea, I'm hyped, but I have to buy a PS5 to play it so, that kinda sucks."
Hyped for a game I won't play because I won't/can't buy a brand new console
"Step aside, Peter. It’s Miles’ turn to shine!! This looks fantastic!!"
"love how it’s only for ps5, so I’d have to buy a whole new fucking console to play."
Sony made a whole game with a black protagonist just to show their support for the BLM movement. Respect
"Ahhhh, so cool! Can't wait!!"
I fucken screamed!!
I can't wait this shit looks Fire
Great way to start off the reveal!
Definitely watched it multiple times.
Now all I need is a Punisher game and a wolverine for the PS5 and I’ll be a happy little Director
Can’t be a spider man game without Peter Parker
This is something we really need right now.
"So, Parker finally kicked it.The responsibility now lies with Morales."
I bought a PS4 back in 2017 for Spider-Man PS4 you're damn right I'm getting the PS5 for this.
Not my favorite of the secondary spidermen but still hype af
Now I know how much is PlayStation 5 is £449 And by the way it's not good be the same without Stan Lee probably he might not be in game
I want
Is NOBODY going to talk about how GORGEOUS the animation style is in this trailer?!?!
I hope this game is open world. That’s all I care about
HELL YEAH
I hope this is a whole game dedicated to Miles and we get a Spider-Man 2 later down the line.
Now this is it!!!!!
"I'm not familiar with this version of spiderman, how come he has electric powers?"
I had to sell my ps4 sadly but now I have a reason to buy a new one or the ps5 with a game like this coming out
Can’t play it
It looks fantastic
Looks awesome
I would play this. I always like Miles More
YES YES YES!
I AM SO READY
YESSSSSSS!!!!!!!!
"I wouldn’t play it cause I’m not a huge spider man fan but I do love the graphics , they just  keep getting better with game graphics, now if only they’d remaster some of the old games and bring them back"
I know it’s a lot to ask but I hope they explore the multiverse so he can meet her and the “hey” move better be a finisher
Release on PS4 alsoooo????
Oh my God
"Although I'm in the Xbox community,  I'm very happy for all my PS brothers & sisters with the debut of Miles Morales"
THEY GOT MILES THE G.O.A.T!
Still have to play Spider-Man PS4 to find out how this is happening so fast. However just saying if they're going to do this I recommend they do a story dlc for upcoming game with Miguel O'Hara. Just saying. Extra money hot off the press already just imagine.
I love how these trailers are like exactly trailers cause that's what they are. Games never look like their trailers. Show game play. I'd like to see that more.
Loved the first 1 but I don’t want to play as a very unknown Spider-Man in milo why did they do that crap! Peter is the 1 with the history with all the best villians
Ooooooooooh SHIT Smiling face with sunglasses Hundred points symbol
Can't wait to be able to play Miles.
underrated game for sure
Hey I like that one!!!
YESSS!!!
YES!!!
Nobody cares abt tht
The best game
Lame
YES! YES! YES!
HYYYYYPED
GOD IT LOOKS SO GOOD
I don't care anymore I'm preordering this console
omg the streams
man this trailer looks damn good !
This looks super cool! But... I’m not interested if they’re brining in a new female character just for a love interest. Not a game I’d buy until after I can see some reviews.
Omg
On god. Im so hyped about this but not getting ps4 though. Been there from the beginning OG player
I love Ratchet and Clank!!
Looks the same
is it just me or does this look the same? i’m still gonna buy it prob
It looks the same as the original one smh I knew this shit was all hype
"What a joke. The game got released in 2013 and we still have no news of GTA VI. Seven years of waiting, and it will be eight in 2021"
They've added some new things I see.
Shambles
Fourth time buying this fucking game.
bro just give us GTA6
We want gtaVI
PC looks better. And it was free a few weeks back
YESSS
Proper muggy. Played that last decade mate.
Bruh xbox event was just as bad im starting to wonder if pc is the way to go
Big disappointment
Wack
Does this even look Remastered at all? It just looks like it's recorded from the PS4.
So are the females on this game still going to look like cinderblocks in the face and body? Serious question.
The graphics look mad shit ngl...I must be used to fivem and the graphic mods but damn son
Surely all GTA games should be classed as racist and pulled from your platform?
Litarally looks the same
Maybe they fucking with us  by releasing old footage... Man that was straight disappointing. Was all excited to watch trailer and within a second to hear Michaels voice I knew this was some BS
Legit me I thought they were announcing gta6 and revealing it Disappointed face
What’s the difference?!!  Really
Talk about milking a dead cow.
Horrible graphics.
Looks good
Great game
SSD at work.
Looks nice
when does it end anyone know?
I want a ps5 now. Fuck Xbox
This one i was talking about
"Oh,wtf? Crazy!"
Wow
OMG what a great Graphics
I love it already
Returnal for PS5 looks very nice.
This has a Death Stranding vibe to it but with more action
Mass effect vibes
Reminds me of annihilation
Damn
This is a love letter to Super Metroid.
Looks like Dark Souls with guns
Karen in Space. The Game
Why are they forcing us to play as Megan Rapinoe
Who the fuck wants to play as a 40 year old soccer mom?
Are they Gonna show console or only games ?
It looks like we gotta fight slender man so I’m in
Xbox I hope you forgive me.    I’m coming back home.
Looks like a ps2 game lol
Boring games!!!!
Saving the best for last? I hope so
These games are so trash bro
It actually looks mediocre
Stop posting games nobody cares abt bruh
These games are garbage!
Why couldn’t we get a twisted metal rebootWeary face
Show  the console
Project athina has been the best title yet
Kinda cool
Ohh boy another one those games....cause boy we don't get enough... Of those....
this game looks fun
Never played a Hitman’s game in my life but this looks interesting.
Nice
Lets go
Now we’re talking!
Best! So far
Definitely the only game I want to play so far out of all the others
Absolutly garbage Conference
"The best thing is it will load faster with the SSD, so you can restart the mission if you missed up."
That means nothing it might be good but it also might be bad. If the previous games are good it doesent mean that automatically this one has to b3 good
bruh they added sweat lines and called it a day 2K the same SHIT every year
Here we go again
That shit looks good
we want gameplay not graphics..
Is this ps5 exclusive?
FIRE
I expected more
"I haven’t bought once 18 cuz it’s the same shit all you need to do is buy once every console generation, I’ll buy this on Black Friday for like 40 bucks and never buy one again"
"Why the fuck are people buying the exact same game but with slightly better graphics and barely anything new in terms of gameplay every single year, it's a waste of money and it's just a moneygrab"
What a great game if you are a nonce.
I'm already thinking of ways I'm going to maneuver the missionsFireFireFire
oh how I am longing for this
This is a welcomed one
"Looks gorgeous, can’t wait"
Bugsnax seems like a game streamers will plays just because it looks “silly”
Acutally hyped
dope
this trailer had me HOOKED
It has potential
Now this looks awesome
"Eeeee, another RE game"
I’m excited
This is my favourite game ever
My dad will hopping on that shit right when it comes out lol
Hell yea!!
They fixed Chris OH SNAP!
This game is too hard  they suppose to stop producing it.
This looks unbelievable
yeah
break open the piggy bank Face with tears of joy
Ahhh I want it now!
How is no one talking about this?!?!?! I thought I'd see alot more people hyped for a new Resident Evil!
This Chris sucks
Exactly looks like a nightmare
I hope it won't be based on online play online.
I can wait
On Xbox as well look decent but I’ll wait for gameplay don’t want another death stranding incident
Finally the game we all want
I love horizon zero dawn  it is my favourite game ever
Literally no point in me spending £1800 on a gaming pc as now I have to get this! First game is immense and can't wait for more!
"Yup, my partner is a massive fan of the first game, shes eager to get the new console for the second haha"
Is this a new 1 or expension
This is the sequel. It's actually called Horizon II: Forbidden West
LETS GOOO
Yes let's get it
Yoo. I thought we were never getting a sequel.
I went blind ...
Is the metal devil in this is hades aswel also is sylence back
"YES, YES, YES!!!!"
Now this is what I'm talking about!
I must have this game
"Snoozefest of a showcase, looks like ps4 graphics disguised in a router"
This is what I wanted! Yes!
That's it. I'm buying PS5.
Never even came near a ps4 let alone 5
The most beautiful surprise from Sony
Smiling face with heart-shaped Horizon is back
welp looks like I'm getting a ps5 now lol
Those stills man Smiling face with heart-shaped eyes
"didn’t know this until now, but I’ve been waiting a long time to longbow a roboturtle"
Ugly design
Never thought I’d be horny for a gaming console but here I amWoman shrugging first for everything I suppose
GOD DAMMIT IT LOOKS BEAUTIFUL
looks like an internet router
whoa
Wait what?
so damn sexy
YES YES
Beautiful
Yo this is fucking beautiful ngl
It looks awsome
Oh goddamn that's beautiful
Wow
She's beautiful Smiling face with heart-shaped eyes
This is the real deal
Nice look didn't expect that
"Wow, stunning. It would make a fortune dancing on TikTok"
It’s quite unique wow
That digital thoe
Pre order date and cost would be nice good presentation
It's beautiful!
This is the best day ever of my whole entire life
Price?
That line up sucked.  What about your multiplayer community?  I will not be buying this console now.  Great design though!  It looks sick!  Let's see what Microsoft has to offer.  I hoped they watched this and learned.
it looks so beautiful.
Router
You’re tempting me king
she too sexy that girl thicc
By far the sexiest console I have ever seen! And I started with the ps1
look awesome
yuck
Lowkey looks odd. Not bad but odd
Has the price been revealed??
nice
sandwichmaker
Wow
How much is it
I love the design
digital version looks clean af but it looks like a router made by alienware
I LOVE IT
I want one so bad
Cool it's look like future
Love this now can't wait to get my hands on it
Not so fine
Don't like the look of it looks like an Xbox 360
"This beautiful design, a breakthrough into the future.."
So damn sexy
it is a Internet router
Top staff !!!
Omg going to be amazing
This looks insane!
"May i please have one? I'll be a researcher, reviewer whatever you need! Just donate one to me with all the accessories.. I'll be your social media positive rating fanatic... please??"
How much for it here in the United States?
looks like i’m spending all my money onna building from Dubai.
Looks like a fuckin wii
Looks like something from Star Wars. Looks good though!
We need a price!!!
No price.  No real titles in the launch.  No price reveal.  I mean if it came in black it would be sweet but even then unless they come out with some sweet exclusives nothing in the launch to make me want to go buy it which is disappointing
it’s a reversed penguin
yes it's awesome I want one
Ok ps5 looks like a router then what does the Xbox look like
Looks like a Mandalorians helmet got squished
Can't wait
"I don't give a fuck about how ugly its looks, I want to know the price"
WTF ?? Did Sony hire to Elon Musk and he design it ?
How much do you think Sony is gonna ask for it? I think since the economy is so bad it will be very expensive I’ll say almost a thousand dollars. What do you think Thinking face?
Looks stunning when can I get one
Epic......
See you soon
When is the pre-order? Absolutely beautiful.
It looks like an xbox!
So now it's by force to have my console be vertically placed
Price for it?
Wow Tesla sharing ideas with Sony
Price?
it is alien console?
It's a unique design and something totally unexpected that's for sure.  Its growing on me and I cant wait to get my hands on one!!
It's amazing
Cool
Yes beautiful design... But where is final fantasy xvi??? Where is god of war 2???? Where is the next chapter I f ffvii remake?? Where is marvel avengers??? Where is the next kh title?? The list is big of missing titles... thanks god for horizon 2
that looks awful
It's perfect
selling my kidney for this
Is it just me or this looks like na Xbox
The design is absolutely gorgeous. Truly looks like the future. I was hoping we’d get pricing and pre order stuff but I guess they’re going to wait until E3 would normally be next month.
How much cost it?
I want to know is what is going to be the dang price.
My left kidney is gonna be sold
Nice
Sexy
Meh I mean is that really all the games they have to offer?
price!
You are dreaming
Price?
looks like it doesn't have a disc slot... i'm out.
So nice looking
Great
what a joke how’s the system look that nice
Does it come with the headset and camera and control or those are separate
"I love it , it has a unique design"
I'm assuming the Digital version will be 100.00 cheaper...
Take my moneyyy
This is a new level
YES SIRRR
Am fucking hyped
Honestly I’m not hype for that price
Not that nice
ugliest shit ive ever seen
Won't even fit in my television console.  Wicked disappointed.
Ay man a free ps5 for me would do...
Nah I'm getting the refrigerator
Looks good but I still dont see the big deal. Just a nice outfit with/without DVD player?
May i have one please? I can't afford it but y'all can donate it... i deserve it.. please??
Can y’all just give me one
What kind of router is this?
You are lying to yourself if you say this looks good
Why does ps5 have a tumor?
Soooooo the price?
So that’s why it’s 700$
The price is not certain yet
How much does it all cost?
An arm & a leg. Throw in an eye & u get all the accessories. Totally worth it if u ask me.
Some of us can only have fantasies of this console
It looks like if a Detroit:Become Human android turned into a gaming console.
Why is it white
You getting one for me
Sexyyyy
Price yet
How much is it?
We gone need this in all black or we will not be buying shit
Digital edition a W but the other one was an L
Called it
That looks clean
Beautiful
Looks like alien ware design.
Do those come with the ps5
This is really amazing.
Alright just take my money!
Prettiest console ever made
SWEEEEEEET
That’s gonna get dirty so fast
Finally. Baby is here!
How much is it already?
I think there are two
Need to see that black version
Sexy router
Orgasmic!!
Imagine thinking Xbox is better
Awesome
I can hear this tweet saying “Buy Me”
Will it come with the usb to charge the controller or do we have to buy the charging station too?
Wow what a nice brand why dont i wait for ps5
How much change from a grand will I get ?
Can i have a look at the pro and Slim Versions
Wow how did they fuck up that bad.
Ugly .
L. 3/4th of the games were garbage.
no matter how hard you try to hide that loaf ass vase of console design behind little big planet..
Looks amazing
It is amazing. The first one was terrific.
Where in the world is this set? Isn't the first one set in the US?
"This game is gonna be something else, already cant wait"
I heard it’s 800 lol
I am so excited! Can‘t wait!
I waited the whole stream just for this trailer. I hoped so much that there will be a new Horizon Game
I want
This what I been waiting for
Where is the *only on playstation*?
Why am I hyped like I have enough cash for a PS5?
Damn nice1 rich graphics
When’s the release date man ?
But what about price& release date??!!?
Man imagine all the dust that’s gonna get into that thing....
Where do they sell kidneys
When is the release date?
This is damn hot
That PlayStation is living in the year 2050 while we still at 2020
still want Xbox?
Now thats a sexy router
I’m lost rn
how much it cost tho
What’s the set price?
Dope
don't care about the consoles but I did like the designs of every Playstation so far.This one looks ugly though.
Wow! Beautiful
I had to forward the video to min 1:55
Price?
Design is good I like it.
Alright time to sell some kidneys
Looks awesome
Any chance will see RDR3 ?
This looks like wakanda tech. Is it made out of vibranium??
Not exciting the same color as my standing water filter cuckoo.
Am I the only one who struggled watching this video because of the patterns? There should have been a warning that people with Trypophobia should watch starting in the middle of the video!
Really hope that digital version isn’t under a 1tb storage
It's real life??Fire
Sold
Yes
Sorry but Miles >Peter
epic
Helll yeahh
Black spider
Terrific
Nah why is every thing about race
A shame they didn't keep the comic-like stylistic from the movie. Would've looked great.
This I can fuck with.
This game is gonna be incredible
Excited for new horizon
I cannot wait!!
Love it
I can't wait! I really hope it's a launch title or slated for early next gen
Glorious!
Very excited
I can't wait for this game!!
Is it gonna be available at launch
Can’t wait for this game looks incredible
Definetly grabbing this one.
Hoped to see the next God Of War game
Trash
Is it for vr?
Good
Robot no trash like last
So much fun!
Best looking game shown better than unreal engine demo
When's Sony5 coming?
I’m soooo hyped but if I buy the regular PS5 not the digital only can I still download games
How does Aloy keep her arrows from floating away?
The future of gaming clearly is PC. Why does anyone need a console if there is a PC?
Wow
The future looks so amazing
I'm speechless
Dope.
Wow
Am I dreaming This is so real......
aww
Awesome
Why do I feel like this is a sequel to Dragons dogma
Hope this a launch title
sick!
No interest
The red one is disgusting
Soft Smiling face with heart-shaped eyes
It looks better all black
Beyond amazing
Red and black for me
The console is cool...but the game is not. Only Demon Soul for me only
Id really love to see an all black or all white version.  Im not feeling two tone
The Spider-Man skin looks cool
Please tell me this is not fake.
The PS5 is UGLY Af.. Xbox looks better like they should of went with the slim playstation the controllers look like the Xbox controller.. this PS Is A Disappointment
I thought they were gonna show the menus tooLoudly crying faceLoudly crying face
Cool
I'm lovin it already
Oh yes
is it the startup after or there something before this one hmmm
"They didn’t sneak it, it was on purpose given the fans a little look at the UI, which was explained is going to have some extra added features"
Rip xbox
I got excited at that point  I thought we were getting UI preview. Face with open mouth
It looks like a xbox 360
Heaven
That looks freaking sick and I bet it would change with the themes or you can change it through different ones in the settings
"Hmmm still not impressed, here i was hoping for a remastered music intro of the PS1 or at least just a little of it, oh well Pensive face"
was that not for the playroom?
the startup does look cool
That’s really cool!!!
I doubt it that just the start up screen for Astro game
I would think it better if they took the ps2 footprint with that opening. please
YESSSS
who cares? just tell us how much it will cost so we can decide what/who to sell!!!!
pretty slick
U will do all this and then the game comes out and there are alot of bugs.
Umm why did they make mbappe run like Neymar for his penalty run up ? Face with tears of joyFace with tears of joyFace with tears of joy With and English voice over
Can’t wait
I’m buying ps5 first then this
Best Part of This Trailer Is Sterling Bodying Moura.
Coming Soon to Manager Mode: Nothing.
Is it free to play life Fortnite?
Wait so you are forcing fans to buy ps5 in order to play fifa21.
You’re releasing the same game for $60 fuck yeah
Fix career mode or get fucked
dont care
I want a better game or fuck off
"You guys suck, FIFA needs a partnership with a new developer."
I knew this is the case. PS5 has some sort of smart delivery and it’s just the same without any marketing from Sony.
"If u buy ps5 at launch, you will just be playing the Ps4 games and some ported games. I rather wait for new titles, slim version and price drop. No hurry."
I'm just going to wait for the ps5 version. Considering we haven't seen any gameplay footage running on the PS4 or XB1 I'm 100% certain this game won't look that good & run well on these consoles.
My PS4 currently sounds like a 747 taking off so I can only imagine what Cyberpunk will do to it. I’ll be waiting to pick this one up on next gen.
"Laughs"""" ooh ok.....Careful now...They might delay this shit....."
"Since you're talking about the PS4 game itself and not the PS5 console, doesn't that make the game compatible, not ""backwards compatible"
Cutscenes i guess. I dont think ps or xbox is good enough to provide such graphics in gameplay.
How much does it cost though?
This game looks so cool with a beautiful story Can't wait to play it!
The game looks like a movie.
This looks like it’s gonna be interesting game that I want to play when it comes out.
This game I can’t wait for! Love the style!
I honestly cannot wait to play this
This is so SEXY
"There should be more games where you can be the monster, not the hunter"
Can’t wait bro!!
I thought they canceled this game
my favourite game.
"Please they should release the game if they want to, and stop all this teasing"
I’m ready for these scary games this generation. My mind is right.
Love the last picture.
I know its just screenshots but hot damn this looks fire
Cool
"Oh goody. Chris is insane and instead of a Mansion, you get Horror from a giant Castle...with Wesker gone, we can only fear the coming worst that can happen..."
The graphics ain’t shitty anymore
PS5 Pre orders please!!!
I wanna be able to fly as iron man as far up as that guy with the lightening
Take my money
I want
wow
we on this ?
looks awesome
Wouldn't mind playing that
I def see improvements
Yes
Looks beautiful
We really need a Spider-Man add on!
iron man thicc as hell
Looks like renderings and no ingame screenshot... boring
That’s better!
Woah it's gonna be huge!!Fire
woow
Finally...i can be kamala?
"Ah yes, p5s. I'd love for it to come to the west but unfortunately that seems far off doesn't it?"
Avengers... go to next gen..
square enix ? oh god ... nice cgi bad gameplay is approaching
Whos that girl and wtf they changed the whole concept its pretty cool but i wanted to see an original game for the avengers
can’t wait for the entire thing!
so it's a movie?
Looks like ubisoft quality.That means bad It just looks.... Bad
"Some of this game looks OK, and then some of it looks very mobile game.  Like all the explosions look terrible.  Also the impact on the environment looks really bad.  Thor's hits and such - these kind of effects would have been OK on Xbox 360, but PS5? No way."
The combat looks so clunky.
No gameplay?
These are so fake stop spreading them like they're real
Cyberpunk one is tuff Fire
The cyberpunk design is really cool and bright
YOO I love the Ghost of Tsushima one!
I would pay extra money for that Ghost of Tsushima style - it looks badass!
PlayStation better takes notes of us fans!!
Filthy. And not in the good way.
"Xbox guy making design for ps5 and getting that thing retweeted by playstation . Divided by consoles united by ideas , aha !"
This person should get paid for this Thumbs up
Cool... We want one for The Last Of Us Part 2.
I'd buy the Ghost of Tsushima one.
that ghost one is nasty
"I'm not a PS guy at all, I'm all Xbox, but those look sick. Nice designs."
These aren't official as of yet. Just fan designs.
dont get your hopes up nerds
Not going lie that cyber punk looks really cool
When are you gonna sell those I want the one that has the red and black
bro omg they look so fking sickkk!
Wheres the demon souls custom design
The horizon one looks pretty fucking dope
GoW please......ill buy that shit right now
Can I get the Cyberpunk variant? Please...
I would easily pay more for the cyberpunk version! Looks bomb as fuck
I feel as if this console would easily break the moment I take it out if the box
In an upright position it still looks terrible
Huh those are all actually really cool. Nice line up for collectors / fans.
The ghost of tsushima one is wild
They all look terrible.....I figured out why....they are all ps5.
All of them look damn good
Do i get the leaf with the ghost of tushima edition?
Not a big fan of the Horizon Forbidden West console. Looks like it has fungi all over it.
checkout the Cyber Punk skin
yes please
"Gaudy and Unappealing. I don’t want a mossy artifact, a Bumblebee toaster, or black scrolls anywhere near my entertainment center."
Cyberpunk looks cool but it would probably stand out very much in the living room. Wife wouldn’t be too happy
Ghost of Tsushima one is dope. All 3 are nice though.
Ghost of Tsushima absolutlely
"I can only afford one, stop showing me the awesome!!"
I wanna eat the cyberpunk controller's joystick pads like they are the blue scooby doo gummies
Cyberpunk and horizon are a bit trash but the ghost of tsushima one ngl do be looking Fire
All three are pretty sick
Would get either cyberpunk or horizon
The options are endless with the ps5 designFire
They're all amazing but I'm a big fan of Horizon so I'd get that one
We want the grand turismo style
I'll have one of each Grinning face with smiling eyes
I like the Ghost of Tsushima design
I wonder how an Elden ring one would look
"Ghost is God tier Horrizon not good not bad, Just cool A Cyberpunk, to much C tier"
Are this going to be real or just fan made?
Ghost of tsushima tho...
dope
Ghost of Tsushima Red heart
Awesome Thumbs up
The Cyberpunk one looks awesome
The PS5 controller looks really uncomfortable to play with for long periods
"Anyone who has played the game, is Ghost of Tsushima worth buying?"
Ghost one Smiling face with heart-shaped eyes
Ghost of Tsushima is the best then Horizon Fire
All three of these are absolutely mind blowing. Whoever designed them is fantastic and needs to be lifted on high!
Horizon Red heart
I need that ghost of Tsushima oneLoudly crying face
I saw a last of us part 2 one the other day and it looked gorgeous Smiling face with heart-shaped eyes
COD please.
I want it the cyberpunk one
Wow totally amazing
"Oh, GoT looks incredible"
That's freaking amazing dude
Ghost of Tsushima Smiling face with heart-shaped eyes
"oh damn, that horizon one :O"
HORIZON 2: Forbidden West for me
I'm an Xbox guy and I got to say the ghost of tsushima one looks amazing
What's wrong with the first gen ps5 then? There's always things wrong with first gen PS
"I would easily buy any of them. Im a call of duty adict so, please create one for call of duty cold war."
I would buy all of these
He's more like PlayStationPope to me.
Cyberpunk minus the blue joy sticks that I love
I want one for Dirt 5
launch date
"Ghost of Tsushima, take my money..."
This looks like my WiFi box
That Ghost of Tsushima design tho Eyes
I kinda thought the trailer for ghost of Tsushima was a let down it really just looks like assassins creed if there were one based in Japan
The spider man miles Morales is the best and it is not even there
I need that Ghost of Tsushima one
I would have the ghost bow it looks mint
I want the ghost Tsushima one to be real
All of these are amazing
I just want it in black
Do a lord of the rings sauron eye costume :D
The cyberpunk one Star-struck
I'd definite get that Tsushima one!
YOOOO.
Bruh
I'm an Xbox guy but that horizon one looks fire
Love the ghost one
The ghost of tsushima design looks so dope
These look amazing.
I would get the cyberpunk 2077 controller and play it on the horizon forbidden west console
Why are people so into these when they aren’t real? I don’t get it.
Ghost Top
The only thing that bothers me about concepts are that they’ll sadly never be released as is. Or not even nearly as cool as these concepts.
How about one for Demon's Souls Remake?
That GOT design Ok hand
Make a GTA5 or 6 system
I like the Cyberpunk one the best
"The PS5's design still hasn't won me over, but that Horizon design is probably the best looking PS5 rendition of all of them."
first time i feel like custom designs blows the original console out of the water completley. Now i feel like i for sure will not buy the PS5 till something like this is available.
Cool looking but still hell no
Luv it!
I love these.
would be all over that Ghosts of Tushima one. Classic black and red lol. Looks insane. I want one.
Wish I could have more money... They look like real next gen consoles
would buy eiter the Horizon or the Cyberpunk one in a heartbeat.
How much it cost
that ghost is clean
could you make a silent hill theme ps5 I'm honestly hoping at the very least if the rumors are true and it's exclusive to the system we could get an awesome special version
Damn I wished these where real!
I would take the horizon version
They all look amazing.
I want one of everything plz
Holy hell these look nice. Especially the black and red Ghost of Tsushima one. Want
Next time make colors more complex and customizable with custom gpu cpu with different with the controller and 3D art on system
I like all 3 of them but I'm going with the Horizon Forbidden West edition
These are amazing.
Holy shit those are dope
Horizon ugly AF
Sick of seeing xboxpope custom designs none ever will get mass produced boring.
Where’s the card board and tape design you showed in the reveal for the PS5?
Now you can't sit there and tell people these don't look sick.
LOOK HORRIBLE GROSS BAH
I'm guna be going for xbox this year bc that design is fucking gross
When can we pre order ?
Xbots act like it wasn’t
This game actually looks pretty good
can’t wait to get my hands on the pa5
I need this
Thank god my tv is 120hz.
Does any one care for this game?
Hell yeah cant wait for this shit take all of my money
"So um, y’all not gone use the suit from the movie!? That suit way more lit that this one..."
Not real
They should ship black cases with that white label
They’re really emphasizing the white I guess
HYPE HYPE
Not sure this is real
Who wants to play Spider-Man on PlayStation 5
They must have some sort of surprise for the back because I’ve seen so many people show the control but not turn it around
How much will cost  ps 5
It's just a bad copy of a Xbox Controller
Can't wait
"Oh that’s fucking big, what about people with small hands"
We don't need anymore HYPE VIDs...Start the PRESALE...Face with tears of joy
not for this design
I look forward to crushing everyone in the arena this is definitely going to be one of my favorite multiplayer games on the PS5
Shiiieetty that looks beautiful
I can’t wait to play this!
This game looks fun but i dont know If i want to spends My money on this when there are so many other amazing ps5 games coming out
Makes me think of Twisted Metal.
Bring back MOTORSTORM
Looks like a fun multiplayer. Wont pay 60$ for it.Of course.
We won’t see noticeable differences for a few years
at first I thought this was rocket league
That's look like PS3.....
If ur not a true Batman fans or even play the games then probably u won’t know what this is
Court of owls
"Better be exclusiiiveee, just to really kill XBOX Rolling on the floor laughing"
PLEASE TELL ME IT AINT ANOTHER EXCLUSIVE
There is not a single hint in there thats leads me to believe that this has anything linking batman
Give us the console release date and price instead of games you can give us those after you release the console release date and hopefully price as well
People who really think this game is gonna be an exclusive on PlayStation are ridiculous. The game if anything will have PlayStation exclusive content like Batman Arkham Knight.
Can’t wait
OMG
Looking forward to seeing this!!!
Give us the Ps5 pre-order date!
Not much to go on heyFace with tears of joy
What is this supposed to mean I don't understand
Court of owls Face with hand over mouthFace with hand over mouth Batman is going to get fucked up Face with tears of joy
Should be on Xbox after 2 years
Court of owls
It's the court of the owls
Be an exclusive for PS5 so can laugh at Xbox
It's a PS5 exclusive! Hooray!
Batman exclusive on PS5 Exploding head
Why do they hate superman so much??
What???
Very WWII Esque.
Fuckkk yeaaaa bro that is fireee
This is a joke right??
When can I send my money man? Killing me over here!!!
Is it like black ops 2???
meh.
"Ah yes, Representative Propaganda Capitalism vs Communism I love it"
I’m guessing if I buy it for PS4 I’m gonna have to drop another $70 on the ps5?
The left side of the cover doesn’t look good tbh
It's a good concept but I prefer just simple cold war logo in the title
Finally some vibrant colors. It’s not just soldier number #14 standing in the middle with a gun in his hand.
"Finally someone with sense. This is why in my opinion BO3 was the most fun I've ever had on a call of duty because of how vibrant the colours were and I've even played BO2, MW2, MW3 and CoD 4."
That would look fire though if it was real
if I buy it on PS4 will I have to buy again for ps5 or can I play ps4 games on ps5 when it comes out?
Wouldn’t give a fuck if spongebob square pants was on the cover.... as long as the game is good
I like this better
Cold war is coming out on ps4 first right?
Woah! I love it
when this is out we back on it
give me
Super clean Fire
That’s clean af
Fire Fire
You should change it with black and white cd case to make it a little different than ps4.
Will the game be for the ps4 also ?
This looks so nice
Thats fire
Magnifique Smiling face with heart-shaped eyes
This actually looks dope
I hope doesn't have to download like 20gig online like advance warfare ps4
i was thinking bout buying the ps5 digital but damn shit makin me want to buy Disk drive.... That cover art work is insane
It’s ehh I think they should put woods on the cover
Waiting
this too looks like a fridge
finally a cover that isnt just a random soldier holding a gun
SUPER clean imo
Looks awful
"Oh yeah, a game I don't care about. Can we get RE8 cover art please?"
I’m 20% sure this will end up as the cover.
tbh i may not be hyped for the game cause of the last iterations but I gotta say this is a nice looking case
Very nice I wonder does it come on xbox cause I don't have the funds currently to buy a new console but still cod games are getting pushed out fast it's impressive
Wouldnt want this hanging in my game cupboard if they paid me...
Please tell me this shot is on ps4
I'm a big xbox fan but this does look clean. Xbox will have that big sticker in the middle of ut
Terrible
I like that but i think this could be better like uuuh gravity rush 3? Or PlayStation allstars round 2?
Nice i love it
Is it also coming to the ps4?
Is it out for Xbox
It’s so much better than other cods
This makes no sense bc the cold war had little to no fighting
Another COD
Ugly
That white makes it look ugly
Dope shit
I NEED a PS5! This looks dope!!
They could’ve done so much better on robin costume
yessss
I'm wondering if the story took place after Arkham Knight cuz if that's the case then I'm going to be absolutely excited with this and if it doesn't take place after Arkham Knight then what's the story about I wonder? Well either way we'll find out eventually
Looks the same as arkham series. I wouldn’t buy this one sorry
Looked crap.
Batman is dead there's no point of buying it
Change the combat system tho. The system y’all using is played out. Take a page out of Ghost of Tushima.
It looks good
FUUUUUUCK YEEEEEEESSSS!!!!
Looks awesome
It looks dope
So perfect!!!!
Yes sir
yessss
This was so disappointing Disappointed face
I'd rather use Batman.
Gotham Knights: Unity
Let’s goooo Partying face
"That graphic tho, so beautiful Smiling face with heart-shaped eyes"
It’s clearly not a Batman game. Just look at the title
You’ve lost us.....can’t even give your loyal customer base details.....sad
Hope they fixed the slowdown
Looks amazing can’t wait
More gameplay on PlayStation 5. Is there something wrong with the XSX or something?
Madness
Wtf Loudly crying face Loudly crying face
Hopefully it wasn’t written by the same people who did the will smith movie.
woooooow amazing Face with tears of joy
OH SHIT
I don’t know about this.
shut up and take my money
So glad it’s next gen only.
Damn that looks good
2022?! That’s next second years!!! WOW Star-struck
Wow Fire Fire
I swear you win me with this preview. Their personalities are perfect. Don't ruin this!!!
I really hope it isn’t  RPG
I didn’t think Sony was going to be at Gamescomm this year?
Looks distinctly average same as pretty much every other COD game for as long as I can remember
So when can we play battle royale again?
Ok can we play normal modes now?
Looks outstanding! Ronald Reagan looks great and so do everyone else. The best part... Dead silence is a fucking perk... YEEEEEEEESSSSSS!!!
Tbh looks like enhanced PS4 pro graphics
Old news
This was captured on a ps5? Lmao wow.
"holy shit, and this is just on ps5? imagine how it will look on pc with rtx!"
Looks interesting. Looks like a RC-XD could be coming back in multiplayer
So can it be on ps4 xbox one or just next gen
i'm glad we finally got a Vietnam Call of Duty. But the graphics on PS5 dont look no different than a PS4.
Let’s go
Cant wait any longer
The event was rawwwww
This games gonna be real fun for 3 months before we return to MW
Wow this game looks insane !!!!
Looks fantastic love the tone of the trailer
"I just dont wanna be fucking disappointed man , hopefully this is good , it looks awesome . I hope they dont do something stupid and just fuck up everything"
Accurate Ronald Reagan wrinkles confirmed Face screaming in fear
Meeh
End part of the trailer looks like MW movement and engine Thumbs up
them fucking graphics tho wow
Where is MASON ???????
Any word on a collectors edition?
I miss zombies
Damn it I’m gonna save my money for this
"Finally the game I have been anticipating more than the others, the game that officially replaced Fifa as the must have games. Can't wait!!"
killing it!!
"Just think everyone, no matter how good it looks in this trailer, it will look even better on Xbox and of course PC. Grinning face with smiling eyes"
Am curious about how it looks on the xbox series x
Amazing graphics
So I have a feeling Russia and China will ban this game Smiling face with open mouth and tightly-closed eyes.
Sep 9th huh same day the rumors say ps5 preorder will go live
This game looked so fire
Down right awful
Looks like warzone ... lol same old same old shiiiiiiit
Will look and play better on the Xbox Series S
This be mad adventure
Hahahaaa it's amazing bro.. Trust me it's not as easy as this video makes it look.. I'm still struggling with Call of Duty WWI
Looks quality that pal
Nice
We need pricing dates and preorders
Now the release date of the ps5 and the price please
No no no no Notorious!!!
I can’t fu**** wait for this game!!
i SEE THE COMMANDO IS BACK
I don’t know the gunplay and sprint style look very sluggish
I thought they announced PS5 prices and whatever.
Not seeing anything new with call of duty tbh.. same old same old...
Heck Yeah Let's Go
"No one cares, where’s the ps5 info at!?"
This is mad luxurious and we fucking!!!!!!
this looks fun...
This looks fantastic!!
My favourite game
So multiple coldwars. I think it's called a coldwar
Amazing PS5 gameplay
Black ops out did them self
Fuck war zone
Cold War nah man it hot war this shit is lit
"Low key, slaps"
Great game
Looks like crap!
honestly I’ll play the fuck out of this shit
Nope
Piss poor remake.
Still not impressed with the graphics...  A ps4 or ps4 pro could still handle that graphics
How come the prince doesn't look like Jake Gyllenhaal??? Grinning face with smiling eyes
Niceeee
This looks really bad
How much does the PS5 Cost????
would have been nice if the remastered The two throne instead but this looks pretty cool
"Man oh man what a game this was. Let's hope the remake is as good if not better. Blueprint games should handle remakes, they do great jobs with that"
I remember i had the demo of this on ps2 lol
Just rewatched this movie and was just thinking about how nice it would be to have a remake of the game
Yhoo I can't wait
"Oh boy oh boy oh boy, Yeah! Ooh I can't wait to play it!!"
The Graphics are crap but I'll still play it prince of Persian was one of my all time favourites
Still looks like a PS2 game!
I actually thought this was the PS2 version at first. Graphics are mobile standard.
Looks like ps3
They really should remake Warrior Within. Imagine The Dahaka.
The other two?? No or it will be soon
"So, while I'm not as blown away as I'd like to be by this trailer, it gives me hope. Can you imagine a Demon's Souls level remake of Warrior Within?"
If it's free with PS plus ... aight.
And the price for the ps5?
It's kinda ugly tho.
Are you fucking kidding me? Omg I can't believe I am buying a PS5 before Jan 21!
They must have skip the graphics part..
What’s it coming on? PS3? Doesn’t look very next gen.
Bruh idgaf give me the price
Good game to remake. I know it’s older but I’d like to see more creed like graphics
Was this captured on Ps2 or Windows 98?
"It’s funny how they keep saying PS5 has no limits but it can’t play ps1,2, or 3 Games"
Dangggg
has nothing to do with the ps5 but im still copping Face with tears of joy
Saw one the other day I hadn't seen before. Not sure what the game was it wasn't this one.
Should bring back ps homeFace with tears of joy
goosebumps
Why can’t they just show the price already? Weary face
This definitely has some final fantasy vibes
Play has no limits. PS5 has no price.
is that a game????
I don't get it....
Result Fire Palms up together
Those games are wack
A great begin for this show Let's continue
Booooo
what the fuck is breaking ? there werent any news about the release date as far as I could see. So who did not expect a ff sequel..... in a couple of years
Meh not impressed. To many fighting games showcased for my liking.
Exclusive Rolling on the floor laughing
Thats it! Shut up and take my money #PS5
Why do they keep making the same games? Games need to be pushed into the future ffs.
here we go again
I'm getting it
Nigga that’s Tyreke From power Rolling on the floor laughing
Kids game bro
THATS  NOT NEXT GEN
LOLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL THE PS5 IS ASSSSSSS
Looks like PS4 graphics Weary face
yo that gameplay was hard !
looked so dope
Don't expect new big graphics difference just because it's ps5. Even the Ps4 can still handle more amazing graphics. Gameplay and story are the most important not graphics. Idiots.
I’m gonna nut
Gameplay was nicee
Looks like my pc when play on low graphic settings Face with tears of joy
Miles did not have to drip so hard in that first pic
That GAMEPLAY WAS AMAZING
Nothing new. I'm not thrilled until I play the game.
Not that great tbh
I'm hearing that it may be a cross gen title? Is there a confirmation of this somewhere?
Sorry but I can’t give any more money to someone who vilifies trans folks
Hot Garbage. Harry Potter is literally the worst shit this reality/ timeline could produce. Absolute garbage.
"People bemoaning the game because of the authors views on trans rights.. fine. But they still eat meat, buy clothes made in sweatshops and drive cars that pollute - just relax lmao..."
"God I wish I could be excited for this and not full a dull, nauseous pain where I once enjoyed the works of Notorious Shithead JK Rowling."
"Could be fun... Too bad the author, who will make money off of this, is loudly opposed to Trans rights."
ps5 is killing xbox... this is a bad look
Niceeee
Does it have a spell that let's me transform into a cat?What about a spell that let's my male character turn into a female character?Why not the latter?
HARRY POGGERS
Gonna buy this just to piss off the Twitter saddos
"Late 1800s, so Dumbledore maybe a student?"
"yo fuck jk but tbh i’m playing the shit out of this game, i’ve dreamed of this for years"
If that shit wont be on pc i will actually cry my eyes out
"After so much time of wanting a game like this, I absolutely refuse to buy it if you know who gets anything"
Play Station only? uh oh looks like ill have to buy both.
Actually looks sick
That looks dreadful
This actually looks pretty good
yes please
Is that Dobby in the clouds??
Holy. shit.
"I had no reason to buy a ps5 other than i wanted one, now Harry Potter comes to play and it’s all hands on deck"
Called it
It looks so good did you cut ties with jkr though
OMG
ITS HAPPENING!
I’m gonna need this
if this gets a switch release do you want it?
don’t have a ps5 but this looks SO good!!
Omggg I would die to play that
IM HARD
Why do I feel like the ps5 is going to take over our lives Upside-down face
kinda wanna play this
I thought it looked kinda shit.
Looked amazing man
A must buy. I'm hoping to get slytherin
"looks interesting, despite the BS from JK recently...."
It looks gorgeous!
Awwwwwwww shiiiiiiiit
Saving money now
We’re getting ps5
Yooooo that’s awesome
OMMMMGGGGG
I preordered it. I’m sorry. We’ll have to eat ramen for a while
LETS GO
YESSSSS
i. need. it
"This Harry Potter better be good, this will be the decider of our gaming future"
omg omg looks like we’re getting a PS5 then
I want it lol
not sure if u seen or not but this looks epiccc
I can’t believe this is actually a real game
Omg buy me a PlayStation
"Sadly, Sony paid to trick people to think it’s exclusive. It isn’t. Also coming to Xbox and Pc."
Bro that’s fucking epic! Fire
if this is coming out on xbox as well im getting it
"Yeah, not sending any more money JK Rowling's way....sorry"
I thought this was gonna be on all consoles and pc?
"Oh man, I was trying to save money. Will need to buy a PS5 now."
Looks unreal!
Playstation won
Can’t wait
kinda cool bruh
THANK YOU FOR THIS GAME
This would make me buy a ps
This better not be a exclusive.....
Hopefully J.K Rowling isn't involved
hype hype hypeeee
IM HYPED
"This game is 3rd party and coming to Xbox and PC next year, don't fear."
"Guys, we need this!!!"
i’m getting PS5 now
I picked a great time to start rereading Man mage
Definitely snagging this.
Awesome!!!!
Let’s go!!! I am excited!
Alright this is fucking cool
Wooah
looks like we need to get a PS5 Smiling face with open mouth and cold sweat
don’t let me down x
This look so dope !
Let’s goooo baby
why does this have to exist
please tell me that it will be on pc
IM. SO. EXCITED.
The theme sounds like Avengers mixed with Harry Potter
Here take my wallet
I feel so bad for the devs that just wanted to make a fun wizard game until JK started being JK
"Sad.Not sad that it's on PS5, but sad it exists"
all other games revealed looked trash
"I'm much of a harry potter fan, but that's still pretty cool"
yes please hey Danny boy ! Wow
I have a lot of thinking to do. Wow this is amazing
IM 100% getting this! Oh my god
look at it. its beautiful
I'm gonna play this!
Finally!
Fucking awesome!
An Alternate Female Version of The Tinkerer Is The Main Villian Thinking face
Amazing!!!!!
Mile's abilities look sick
Cool as shit
Omfg this game is going to be Face with symbols over mouth lit!
Miles looks so amazing.. Imma have what’s up danger on REPEAT lol
It looks freaking amazing. Main reason to get a PS5 for me right now
"Hyped?! Sweet Christmas, this just became my game of choice!"
when exactly is the game coming?
Unrealistic? What is realistic about getting superpowers from a radioactive spider? Just enjoy the gameplay man
WOW
Hyped
The new voice actor for woods sounds like horse shit. Why would they do this Loudly crying face
"I would just throw the RV car at them, if it had an explosive"
Gracias boss
But does it have a battle royale..
Yesssss
I’m not saying those because it’s not original voice actor but the copy cat for woods actually sounds like shit.
That looks really good
Looks awesome
I’m already addicted to this game
Wow!! So much Action going on. LOVE how Mason goes up to the enemies and kills them so many different ways from a grenade to the knife and gunshot to the head!!
Is that a FAL he’s shooting with?
Yeesssss
New COD looks dope asff
That was pretty awesome! Not going to lie! HYPE IS real for Cold War!!
Graphics are not amazing for this to be next gen
"I thought the whole thing was underwhelming...  Where the 60+ fps we were promised, from what I've seen up to now it's no better than the PS4 and Demon Souls, Geez that looked under 30 fps to me"
WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND COD ZOMBIES AND WHY THIS TRASH KEEPS MAKING IT INTO WHATS GAMING IS SUPPOSED TO BE MORE REALISTIC THESE DAYS MAYBE IT WAS FUN BACK 10 YEARS OR MORE AGO BUT NOT IN 2020 IM  DISAPPOINTED ESPECIALLY BECAUSE WE ARE COMING INTO THE PS5 DAYS Thumbs down
trash
that could be the best game presented who knows !
Hope it's out on pc......
Dope asf
I’m so fucking hype
FNAF LOOKED FUCKING AWESOME
Is the price and release date coming out today
This was DOPE
So fucking HYPED for Miles Morales as spiderman cant wait

Actually looks awesome.
Im getting this
Can't wait this is the game im most exited for
This looks absolutely insane.
One word. INSANE
Not a fan of the game but that looks amazing. Only problem is no ones wearing masks
I hate nba but damn that looks goodOk hand
What does that mean?
It means that they have completed the game a d it’s ready to Launch and copies of the game are ready to be printed and sold to the public
Meaning that the game is complete and ready to be put on disks.
It means the game is ready for launch
Can u pre order online with a credit card?
How much storage is this gonna take?
Idk about his suits
"holy shit, is that the second pre-order suit in the third pic? looks fucking lit"
"Love to get this game, if I could get a ps5 pre order first"
Is so clean
It’s..it’s beautiful!
I want it.
This game is going to be GREAT!!! I heard in the story that Peter Parker got jealous of Miles Morales because of his new gadgets. Peter told Miles that... He’s New York’s ONLY Spider-Man. Frowning face with open mouth WOW!
Loving it every day
by this rate we really might be playing it in 2077
I thought it went gold?!!
I HATE IT HERE
"Say CD projet red, don't you know when the thing will be ready, if so you shouldn't have announced it so early, it will probably not be released in 2020, can we still cancel Gog, xbox and PSN purchase?"
I wish I never pre ordered this on my ps4. Right now I need that 60 bux back.
21 days?  I can wait.  No big deal for me.  I’ll still get it day 1
This is to get more sales pure and simple. Holding it back while people get another payday after buying new consoles. No way 21 days makes any difference they are already on disc.
"Do what you gotta do, but I seem to remember y'all talking smack on twitter about other developers not sticking with their release dates.   Y'all are killing us"
Im pretty sure there'll be patches but I like the optimism
Expected. Unfortunate. But expected
"I thought they said ""no more delays""?. But i am glad that there taking the game seriously and trying to fix bugs and glitches"
We will probably finally get this game in 2077
Gonna be 2077 before it’s released
I wouldn't be surprised if we played this game in 2077Face with tears of joy
"Again, seriously?"
"Upset, but I can respect it!"
Wow Again Face with tears of joy Ughh Man
Completely fine by me
"Well I agree with everyone’s disappointment with the delay, the silver lining to all this it seems like the next gen patch is coming this year now.....or did I read this wrong?"
Noooo! Loudly crying face
"Damn, now I need to move my vacation again."
That sucks I was really looking forward to it but at least it means they are making it better.
at this point just release it in 2077
LMFAOOOOOO
Again
GODDAMMIT
Oh word that’s crazy lol
I couldnt act suprised even if i tried to
I might not get this anyway. Or should I. I didn't like the witcher
Theres alot of other good games out there
that’s the day before my bday
we know it sucks....you dont have to tell us again
So why could everyone else do it but not them?
haha SHOCK
Lol haha
WHAT Face screaming in fearFace screaming in fear
"Use me as a ""I'm not surprised"" button"
"This sucks for all the people taking time off to play this game, hope y'all can get your PTO moved Crossed fingers"
we under estimated the amount of bugs to fix for a day 0 patch
Flop of the generation
lol fuck
This is why I said this game may fail Face with tears of joy
Bro what the fuck??? And y’all said no more delays
Are you fucking serious
Weeh Fire
This is probably top 2 best performances I've ever witnessed

When you are awake or sleepin (shhh) Say my name no time
I can't .... I can just tell someone not to tell someone else I promise Loudly crying face Loudly crying face is that fine
Burna boy lyrics
Sold Out.
Can't keep calm
Sure let’s give her invisibility for no reason. I find it especially humorous that they had Kitana display exactly why we didn’t need Mileena in this game with the moves they gave her...so they didn’t need to put Mileena in this game. Yawn.
"Congratulations Mileena fans, we Ash fans admire you and your resilience, and hope the interactions between our characters will be very fun. Our struggle is more complicated due to licences. We ask you for your support and help.Folded hands Thank you. Love you all"
"I want him too, but I'm not gonna lie, Mileena's my favorite, so I'll take her over Ash any day"
"She looks....rushed alot of her moves feel like combinations of other character's moves, and again her voice is a atrocious, almost as if she wasn't meant to be the in the game and was only put in to appease a incredibly toxic fanbase of players who harass and bully everyone"
"Just give it a rest already. Not a single person cares, I promise."
Back to the wheelchair you go Kotal
Someone add Sonic's spin dash sound effect
Dvorah when she sees Mileena spinning towards her like Sonic The Hedgehog Pleading face
her costumes are EVERYTHING!Loudly crying faceSmiling face with heart-shaped eyes
I don’t like her hair in the middle one but that shao khan one is amazing
She’s sooo f*cking good omg
Gotta say the trailer was pretty unique. She reminds me a little of spawn and that fatality she turned into a yo yo lmao. I like how they made her move set really fit her character in general. The only issue I have is the voice. But overall it's really nice.
Another question was this trailer on the PS5 because the graphics looked more high quality
Thanks for Mileena!
Where is her ponytail ?
I hope everyone that asked for her is happy about how she looks and plays!
yea mileena made it in but when will you asses understand there is licence issues with ash the actor of ash said this himeself calm tf down bro if he makes it nice till then chill br
She devoured the whole Kombat Pack wbk
Yay she’s here!!!!
Great job Ok hand Purple heart
she is just so amazing
OH MY GOD IT’S EVERYTHING I’VE ASKED FOR THANK YOU THANK YOU
Take her right back out the game
"Wow.  All that wait,  and she gets a lame ass fatality like that. If I were a Mileena fan,  I'd be pissed."
She’s heeeeeeeeeereeee. Omg she’s so ruthless and rude I love her and happy they kept her that way. Can’t wait to play her
"Bruh,it's fin to be a whole lot of broken controllers and televisions,she everything I wanted and more,,when mileena see's devorah's face....."
im not a mileena stan but her gameplay looks insane and broken controllers is a stretch bro
SHES SOOO GOOD LIKE HER MK X YAAAAS THEY DIDNT RUIN HER SHE IS SOOOOO AMAZING I LOVE HER FATALITY!! SHE PLAYS AMAZING
I LOVE YOU
She did a Sonic spin dash for her fatality Skull
"Y'all didn't have to pop off like this, she's incredible he moves look smooth and her fatality looks insane, im proud of the team who worked hard during these times thank you for your insane work!"
DAMN!!!! I can’t wait to play as Mileena Thee Stallion. It’s over for you scorpion dudebros.
You guys did an amazing kid thank you so much for giving us Mileena she’s awesome and I can’t wait to play as her Sparkling heart
This move and variation look interesting to me. I'm honestly looking forward to all 3 new characters and hope the patch brings some needed gameplay changes
"I really still don't understand the fanaticism for mileena, although the gameplay doesn't look bad I don't see anything interesting or new, it doesn't look very different from mkx"
Mileena The Hedgehog
Mileena fans deserve it ! Right-facing fistCollision symbolI hope the same for Ash Williams before the end cycle of DLC
Still waiting bro Flexed bicepsFolded hands
holy sh*t she’s gonna be a problem lol
and that's why they kept the best for the last
I love her
Her gameplay seems so great and brutal! Thanks for bring back my main on MK since I was a baby
It will be a PLEASURE to perform all the fatalities on Her. Thanks NRS. To bringing me back this character so I can kill her again unlimited times!
"I do miss her pink aura, but that's a minor want. I'm just hype I get to play her! Seems similar to Injustice Catwoman and i fucking love it"
She looks awesome and her throw attack is just amazing
OMFGGGGGGGG SHES HERE
"Although I'm not really a Mileena and I'm still more excited for Rambo, I think that she will be fun to play, she takes some moves from cheetah which isn't really a big problem and I think she has some pretty cool looking skins too. I still dont like her voice btw"
Wtf was that fatality I swear she turned into a yo-yo
Not my bitch playing the knife game on D’Vorahs face Smiling face with open mouth and tightly-closed eyes
They gave her Reptile’s invisibility! And turned her into Sonic the Hedgehog for a fatality! I love this!
we really WON
Omg her finisher is so much Loudly crying face
Damn. That Fatality was sick
I could cry I’m so happy
PERFECT
"I like the outfits, the character model, but the voice and face of the character could’ve been better. She’s still badass as hell tho, but those are the only things that are like a “Meh” to me. I’d still play the shit out of her, but hey, everyone has an opinion. Great work guys!"
"That sonic the hedgehog like fatality Face with tears of joy thinking I’ll like the second fatality a bit more.They gave her invisibility?! Awesome. Her fatal blow looked great, I liked the sai stab to the gut, felt like the mk9 x-ray just really upgraded. Can’t wait!"
And here she is! The Ultimate Queen is back
"wanna say Amazing job to u  with this ladys trailer.. Love Her Mk11  Kostume Design  Her Looks , Her voice , Fatal blow,  Fatality.. everything .. she's my favourite female Kharacter since MK2 in 93 thank you for making her been playable Kharacter in mk11"
"i never usually post on character reveals, but **** me you guys have FINALLY got it spot on!! shes looks great and worth the way. finally, DLC worth being excited about !!!!!!!"
OMFG IM SO MF EXCITED ITS UNREAL
"Thank you for adding the best MK waifu, Mileena, in Mortal Kombat 11! Can’t wait to see her intros with every character! I might start maining her so that I can destroy some D’Vorah mains"
"She is an icon, she is everything, she is the best there is the best there was and best there will ever be.Mileena is the moment.Thanks for adding her 2 the game."
OMG AS A MILEENA FAN FOR SO MANY YEARS YOU GUYS DID ABSOLUTELY AMAZING WITH HER I WAS LITERALLY HOLDING MY MOUTH CLOSED THE WHOLE TIME THANKYOU FOR LISTENING TO US WE LOVE YOU GUYS!!!!!!!!!!!
Did you all see that ball roll holy shit.
IMM CRYING
HOLY FUCK I CANNOT BREATHE
I LOVE HER SO FUCKING MUCH
"Look i am loving the game there is only 3 characters this game is missing to make it better after this combat pass and i believe you should add them Ermac, Reptile, and smoke but that's just my opinion Winking face"
"She looks fantastic and her gameplay is fantastic!! She looks like she is gonna be fun!! She looked fantastic and was fun and fantastic to use in MK 9 and MK X!! I can’t wait for kombat pack 2! I’m excited for rain, Mileena and Rambo!"
That Sonic Fatality was 4/10.
This video just confirmed I will be buying all the things for this game! Idk what you guys are doing discrete since the original charcuterie but I feel like you guys have definitely stepped up your character creation Mileena looks AMAZING with her moveset
So you're telling me that y'all actually made mileena look cool and interesting Thinking face
OH MY GOD SHES HERE AND I FFFUCKINGS LOVEE HER!!
SEEING THIS MILEENA TRAILER OMG I FELT LIKE CRYING WOW Loudly crying face
OMG YESSS AHHH IM SO EXITED
I said she would be one of the strongest/best players and yep I was right! Thank you guys you’ve done an outstanding job. Already pre-ordered so I’m just counting down the days
"Please,add glasses for Cassie"
BEST GAMEPLAY EVER
I’m proud
She’s 100% MK9 Mileena with that MK11 revamp
She looks cool but sadly she looks incredibly limited like everybody else in the game. Spin Dash fatality is dope though
Bro her roll is AWESOME
Bro she's fucking amazing. I can't handle it
"a single warm tear of happiness rolls through my cheek every time I watch it. I can't stop it anymore, all I can do is click on replay and watch again"
BEST CHARACTER IN MK11
Damn she went Sonic the hedgehog on her ass
"Not a big mileena stan but that Khan costume is awesome, also she is fast and made for kombos, best kind of fighters, she looks good!"
Consider me as happy as a clam! WE WON SHE'S HERE!!!!!!!!
My god that is the greatest thing I’ve ever saw. Man this Kombat Pack is already looking fantastic!
She looks cool but sadly she looks incredibly limited like everybody else in the game. Spin Dash fatality is dope though
OH MY GOD SHES HERE AND I FFFUCKINGS LOVEE HER!!
I’m proud NRS
"She looks fantastic and her gameplay is fantastic!! She looks like she is gonna be fun!! She looked fantastic and was fun and fantastic to use in MK 9 and MK X!! I can’t wait for kombat pack 2! I’m excited for rain, Mileena and Rambo!"
Bro her roll is AWESOME
I swear mk players get a new character like every 2 weeks im so jealous
BEST GAMEPLAY EVER
I've never really cared for MK as a whole but that was pretty cool
"Although I'm not really a Mileena and I'm still more excited for Rambo, I think that she will be fun to play, she takes some moves from cheetah which isn't really a big problem and I think she has some pretty cool looking skins too. I still dont like her voice btw"
IM SO STOKED
"Oh look, the abomination is here"
So you're telling me that y'all actually made mileena look cool and interesting
I said she would be one of the strongest/best players and yep I was right! Thank you guys you’ve done an outstanding job. Already pre-ordered so I’m just counting down the days
OMG YESSS AHHH IM SO EXITED
Mileena's fatal blow is sooo BRUTAL..... Probably the best one in the Kombat pack and in the game.
"Meh, why she has a feminist air? I don't like that"
This video just confirmed I will be buying all the things for this game! Idk what you guys are doing discrete since the original charcuterie but I feel like you guys have definitely stepped up your character creation Mileena looks AMAZING with her moveset
"Y'all don't have a problem with Shang Tsung and Spawn using Reptile's moves, but when Mileena has it, it's suddenly a problem?"
And here she is! The Ultimate Queen is back
Is MK11 coming to PS5?
Still waiting...
Now I know this is Mortal Kombat but literallyyy how is she alive
OMG AS A MILEENA FAN FOR SO MANY YEARS YOU GUYS DID ABSOLUTELY AMAZING WITH HER I WAS LITERALLY HOLDING MY MOUTH CLOSED THE WHOLE TIME THANKYOU FOR LISTENING TO US WE LOVE YOU GUYS!
THANK YOU NRS!
OMFG IM SO MF EXCITED ITS UNREAL
"She is an icon, she is everything, she is the best there is the best there was and best there will ever be.Mileena is the moment.Thanks for adding her 2 the game."
this gameplay is amazing I love her and her shao Khan outfit but what the hell is that shaven hair that is not Mileena at all...
I saw the first 10 min gameplay and the swinging looked like choppy I hope it doesn’t feel like that in the game
detail of the clothes still impresses me
That nigga got the high top Adidas superstarsDizzy symbol it’s not better than the aj1’s but still
It’s a leap of faith.
Let's go
Gorgeous.
Can’t wait for this game
Those shoes are fresh
Are they advertising shoes?
Lame spiderman. Spiderman is now Ben 10 Face with tears of joy
fire
Love this so much
Will buy it but not at full price for 10 hour game
Honestly cant wait
The cat at the end though?!Face with tears of joy
I'mmm HYPED!!!Hundred points symbol
I HATE THE PETER PARKER LOOK. SWITCH BACK
Miles looks awesome!
Omg the single most greatest spiderman I've ever witnessed!. ♥ Oh my dayz
So it’s not a different verse every one was saying that so there both in the same verse and not a different timeline
I’ve personally played it since Saturday afternoon and I can say it’s definitely way more enjoyable than the last two. It might just be because I love the Vikings time period but no more gear leveling. The XP you get gives you skill points
That is REALLY higher than expected. I actually wanna enjoy Valhalla tbh. I need a review soon from
Been playing for a few hours now loving it...
I always hoped they would do a World War II Assassin's Creed have it start at Pearl Harbor and go to different battles throughout World War II
Can't wait to play it!!
It runs horribly on a pc with a 3070 with huge amounts of stuttering and crashes
"From ACG's review, I wasn't really impressed with the game. Surprised by these scores."
XBOX AND PS PLAYERS WIN WITH THIS GAME YAHHHHH
IGN really be giving everything a 8/10
Give me a Steam version pls.
IG8 not ign
Shocking
Really Yawning face
Meh
Trash game
Little Hope was pretty trash even compared to Man of Medan so hoping this one is more like until dawn
I actually liked it better. Both were amazing and both plot twists had me in shock but all in all little hope just had a little more detail. Hopefully the 3rd will definitely combine the two
Can we continuously bully you until ash gets added like what mileena fans did
"Don't care, Rambo is boring and lame like this DLC pack. Give me Ash"
please tell me one of his intros is him coming out of the mud
So cool @TheSlyStallone Cant wait to play as Rambo and kill all the kombatants dream come true!!
Please I want reptile
NOBODY ASKES FOR HIM I USUALLY DONT CARE BUT I HATE HIM
Another mortal Kombat pack 2
Everyone wanted this.People are so ungratefull
FUCK YES
TRASH
Funny how @MortalKombat was bullied into adding mileena and also who asked for Rambo?
We didn’t want him.
MILEENA PICS PLS
"Joker, Spawn, Terminator, Robocop and now Rambo. NRS really does their homework on guests."
What will the gear be?
For a guest character I'm happy its Rambo ...one of my favourite movie ..and movie franchise
But why?? You should have just throw another DC character in the loop for even a Street Fighter character. Hell we want Smoke.
I am gonna bully u until u give me ash ermac and reptile like mellina fans did
"Alright, u got Sly, Peter Weller and even Keith David for Spawn, why not Arnie?"
Best Rambo scene ever Face with tears of joy need this in game
Smoke plsss
interesting... not bugging you but how did you get sylvester's voice but couldnt get arnold?
I hope he yells like that in gameplay too Face with tears of joy
People that hating on rambo just never seen the movies Face with tears of joy
who cares give us more Sonya skins wtf
Wow
Well done
You guys did a great thing
Ok now add Optimus prime
Will we get Havik one day?
gameplay trailer please Pleading face
That’s awesome honestly
"Excellent, now I'll just be waiting to see his gameplay :)"
Get @Schwarzenegger to voice the terminator PLEASE
Fantastic.
SHOULD OF PUT KRATOS OR WOLVERINE
I need reptile I am depressed I have bac exam and I won't play mk11 for 1 year I need reptile soon plz
thinking an expendables fighting game would be awesome!
Personal I wanted ash Williams but rambo is fine
Really excited about having my favourite actor in one of my favourite game franchises ever. Mainly him day 1 and never playing another character in the game again until the next nrs game
GOOD!
BRING SMOKE BACK OMG !!!!!!!!!!!!
I thought his reveal would be like terminators having the look but not the voice but they got both. Awesome.
yes
Why ?
YESSSSSSSSSSS
Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy?!??!!!
Let's gooooo Fire
"really wish we got a real horror rep like Myers, Ghostface or Candyman, but I’m thrilled with mileena, rain and rambo"
Lets goooooo
We want Hancock to be an MK character
"Good, I didn't want a hack job imitator doing the voice."
I was shaking with excitement for rambo.
I'm actually shocked and pleased by this somehow. #Rambo was the SHIZNIK back in the days.
I like how mk11 is more action movie oriented then mkx which is more horror based!
AMAZING!
YOU GUYS DEFINITELY SHOULD CONSIDER ADDING JOHN WICK TO THE GAME
"Oml, ok that is cool, yes I want ash but this is great as well, terminator vs rambo"
I get the feeling Rambo vs terminator are going to have great dialogue options
"While I may not have been as excited to see him when the trailer first came out, I've since warmed up...mainly because you ACTUALLY got Stallone back! I'm real proud of you guys."
Thanks very much forever Red heart
Great but can we know get a martial artist as a guest character. Someone like
@TheScottAdkins
Boring but hell yeah I can't wait for Mileena and Rain
We still need one guy...
Thank you son much NRS I love Rambo and Robocop this is the best roster
"This is what I was most worried about, so thank you"
Seriously?!!!!! Hell yes!!!
This trailer was dope! Excited for game play
meh im personally not into Rambo but congrats to everyone who wanted him
It’s great! Thank you for listening to fan feedback about Arnold’s voice being replaced and getting Sly to do the voice acting for his character Thumbs up
"Looking forward to the new Kombat pack! However, I'm surprised Judge Dredd hasn't made it to MK. Maybe MK12?"
I don’t feel comfortable seeing someone doing a fatality on Sylvester Stallone Face with tears of joy
Can’t wait to pin Rambo vs terminator
Love it!!!
Pls bring arnold back to do the voice
Stallone is the GOAT.
Rambo and Terminator in the same game lol
Amazing! I love it!
At first I thought he was gonna be another gunner. But then I see he was holding a bow and a knife. Now I'm curious and excited to see how he plays! Most excited for RAIN though! Grinning face And good for Mileena fans I guess on their queen.
So @NetherRealm is gonna break the PSN network with this oneFire
When can i preorder
"what abous smoke,ermac,havik,takeda? are the coming?"
Yes!
I can’t wait to try out all of Rambo’s bloody fatalities and brutalities.And I can’t imagine what his Friendship will be. Face with tears of joy
Get Chuck Norris too
Y’know I’m a bit weirded out by his colour pallet but I really like the look of him
"This is dope, I never knew I would be so excited to see Rambo in MK and with Stallone voice, let's get it"
Thanks Netherealm for getting the actual Rambo to reprise his role once again he was awesome
Amazing job
"Sweet, having the man who plays Rambo voice his character is awesome"
But you couldn’t get Schwarzenegger ?
"And now, Robocop can arrest John Rambo. Sounds totally ridiculous."
"For those complaining about the guest character of rambo, it's pretty late to complain now because you're obviously still playing the game through the addition of Freddy krueger, Jason voorhees, leatherface, the predator, alien, spawn, the joker, The Terminator . Yeah."
That's awesome.
Thank you
Thats cool.
"Love this John Rambo, looks like the player 2 of Contra 3."
"As a massive @TheSlyStallone fan, I've been smiling all day about this. I hope he had fun lending his voice to the game! To the haters that are talking trash, I'll see you in ranked fights with my new main after 11/17"
"For those who cried about mileena not being in the game, you don’t have to worry anymore"
"Curious, wondering how his special moves gona be. Kombos, brutality and fatality and more interesting his entrace and lines before the match"
I thought this was a joke when I first heard about rambo coming to MK seems very random character for the game but will give him a try when the ultimate edition releases
Rambo is great. But I still wish for Jean Claude   Van Damme.
Oml this is epic
yeah good job
Congrats NRS for getting @TheSlyStallone voice for this game I am probably going to try out everyone in this KP2.
Would've preferred Michael Myers but still cool
Thanks for putting him in the game.
Omg @noobde how you pull this off I would never thought of seeing Stallone being involved with mk
"Please, stop releasing these shit characters. Nobody cares about Rambo.But thank you so much for Queen and Rain."
Oh cool another character to uses guns I can't wait to get a similar animation for attacks for 3 characters now
I feel like Rambo being in Mortal Kombat kind of misses the point of who Rambo is
Ok but horror themed fighting game when?
Who is Rambo
We're so grateful for Mileena and Rain! Thank you
Mileena is gonna be an April fool's joke but not on April
Shame you had to pander to the minimum-enials and gave in with their demands
Add him
"This is a glorious day, no more Mileena demands"
I think there is a reason on why you haven't added a horror guest character to this game.
Lol i love it
This is so satisfying especially since so many people said so many rude things to people that wanted them
This IS a dream Pleading face
How the heck does a character who died in the last game get added as DLC in the next game? that doesn't make sense.
Ok it’s fun to laugh at you guys getting salty but really? Really? They just announced new characters both of which were highly requested and you’re already asking for more stuff. You guys just can’t be satisfied can you
Yes.. it is FireFire to see Arnold (terminator) have a rival Sylvester (Rambo).
The soundtracks on this game gonna be lit.
I feel this is a movie!!!!!!The cinematics looks so incredible that looks like a Movie
SPIDER-MAN IS GETTING RELEASED IN MY BIRTHDAY
When you get the goosebumps you know...
"Not even 10 years ago we got Miles and now he has a incredible movie and by the looks of it a awesome game, I'm so excited to see it 😊."
Insomniac you have really outdone yourself’s like how dod you do this can’t wait to watch
I dont care what anyone says this looks so sick
"I was doing my ""Homework""  but this seemed more important"
"It almost feels like a movie trailer, that’ll get you hyped up even more"
This day we will never forget
"To quote a favorite game reviewer of mine, "" now that was hot""."
Man I can’t wait for this game
The music just makes it even more hype
"so glad i preordered. besides peters face, i don’t believe i’ll have any problems. and even then, peter isn’t the main focus"
My man Prowler gettin the respect he deserves with that outfit.
The small detail of him swinging a bit more freely and energetic adds alot. Looks great sadly im going to have to play it on ps4 cause im broke.
"You know what, tbh, Peter Parker's actually growing on me now!"
Man whenever Miles walks it never fails me to give goosebumps !

I literally can't wait for this game
"I love how this absolutely looks like a movie trailer, video games have come a long way"
Literally everytime I watch this trailer it gives me the chills that's how hyped I am for this game🔥🔥🔥
This Logo Screen gave me fckn goosebumps 😍
"I absolutely love the music accompanying these trailers, Fits Miles pefectly!"
I literally bought a playstation just for spider-man then i ended up getting addicted to all the exclusives.
I did not know that the prowler was gonna be in this. I'm so hyped! Can't wait to get the PS5 and play this game!
I am so hyped for this game!
Every second i watch this game i get more hype for spiderman 2!
"PlayStation, the greatest Showman"
"This got my Spider Sense tingling, looks great!"
Everything about this game looks amazing
I wish i can afford this even the console i cant 😭 im so jealous
Way better launch trailer then The Amazing Spider Man 2
I feel like I'm be left out still playing this on ps4 😂😂😂
Not gonna lie games such as these want me to leave the pc's alone and just get a ps5
I feel like it's gonna be a dark game i don't know why
Stop selling me dreams that I may not afford to get anytime soon :(
Just look at Miles’ uncle. He is super cool. Even his green claws. I wish we could’ve played with him
whew LORD. This just hyped me tf uppppp. 3 more days. Can't wait!!!
Awesome Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales Launch Trailer.
"WOW, we are going to get a cat as a side kick"
That's how the new generation is coming out. And it's great!
"Playing a game like this will be huge for me. I actually love spider man, miles, the soundtracks and everything!"
Only a few more days when we can get our hands on this gem!
why would anyone dislike this masterpiece i don't get it
This game’s gonna be LIT!
You can tell that they're learned a lot from Into The Spider-Verse. And I like that.
bruh how many pumped up trailers can we have anymore!!
I’m so hyped to get my hands on this game in only 3 days!
This game looks so beautiful I forgot it was an actual game and thought it was a movie trailer.
The Prowler looks Amazing!
I love the way Miles walks❤️
miles went from hiding from rhino to tackling him head on
Has to be one of the coolest launch trailers out there for one of the coolest games. 😎
This whole November is just Spider-man Miles Morales for me... So Hyped🔥
"This is making me at hyped, the game looks like it puts him in situations where he is forced to change and prove himself to the city and its really gonna push him to his limits"
This is up there with the greatest video game trailers of all time.
The marketing for this is amazing goddammit and this trailer is by far the best
we have gotten to point were the trailer looks exactly like the game.
Can’t believe I get to get my hands on this game this week😭
That soundtruck is amazing.
"Miles is such a relatable character, the whole comparing thing just hit something in me that I tried to forget"
Broke boy watching over here
The trailer music seriously hyped me up!!!
I really hope I end up getting the PS5 on launch day. So I can play this game
Well this just made the wait from now till Thursday so much longer
I'M WAY TOO HYPE FOR THIS GAME.
"Love the trailer, but I still can’t say I like the new face for Peter, he look younger then miles, like, a lot younger"
I just realized they never released a trailer
Im gonna get this on the ps4 so excited Thursday couldnt please come quick
All right insomniac i forgive u for the face change this looks lit!
This games soundtrack bodies the avenger game itself
Broooo I got chills from this trailer. I can’t wait to play this game.
The only problem with this trailer is the 'new' face of Peter.
This is about to be the longest 3 days of my life
I can’t wait for the soundtrack to drop tomorrow!
"I’m so confused, is Aaron working with Miles? Either way, I’m so hyped."
This game is going to be epic can’t wait to play it on Thursday
I waited too long to pre-order a PS5 😭 biggest regret of 2020 so far.
"Yes, The Prowler is going to appear in this game."
"If we can play as The Prowler, bro! This game is gunna be wicked!!"
Imagine how amazing graphics will look by the end of the consoles life
HE LOOKS SOO SICKKK
His move set and that fatality are sick af!!!
Get a bucket and a mop for this wet ass prince
"Man, Kotal just can't catch a break, huh?"
Who cares where is mileena
"Please let Rain's Friendship be of him serving someone pancakes in purple rain. If you can do that, you can have my wallet."
he looks so COOOL!!!!
"I can’t believe I paid almost 130 CAD for MK11 and kombat pack 1 preorder, and you’re selling MK Ultimate for 80 CAD. Shame on you. At least now I know to wait for a year or two until purchasing. Man that’s a smack in the face to loyal consumers."
Nerf this stupid Jade
LETS GOOOOOOO
That fatality was wild.
YOOO THIS IS SICK
after that spawn trailer no one trusts them anymore
THIS WAS SICK
Not feeling that fatality
"Damn, that voice acting was pretty bad"
"Fucking amazing. God im so happy. The fatality, the victory pose, the design, the skins, the moveset, i aint even mad that he seems to not have bubble"
Rain looks SO amazing! But can we please have this skin?
His voice is pretty meh. It's too high pitched. Lol
Can you guys work on adding crossplay to PC in the next update or the next game please?
"Love the moveset, love the fatal blow. Fatality was good. Only thing I'm not feeling here is the voice. Idk if it's just my ears being defective, but I remember MKX Rain having a MUCH deeper voice than this. Wish we had that. Not that what we have is bad."
Got damn!! NRS... Y'all made him better than ever. Definitely copping this dude next month!! Whole style is incredible.
So Rain doesn’t have his around-the-world roundhouse kick anymore? That’s like taking away Scorpion’s spear or Sub-Zero’s ice ball.
"Weird how they are saving the worst character for last, but rambo looks amazing, definately the best outta this kombat pack"
His game play actually looks really sick!
Kabal just running over the mine like a dumbass. lol
I'll be honest This kinda ass
"I don’t know who goes harder, him or Rain.. Rain move-sets are fucking crazy too"
The crawl was insane Face with tears of joy
I just realized that the arrow he puts through your head is the same one he shoots you with after kicking you away. That's badass.
Not a big fan...after Rain he looks pretty useless to me
waiting for Chuck Norris!!
a flop already Yawning face
aight he's pretty fuckin cool
Us preparing to take him into Practice Mode:
"Damn he looks bloody. I love it. But he’s a slow but tough character, which is unfortunately not my type of character..."
Looks great!! Can’t wait for these features!
the face in the end creeps me out tbh
"Just want Cyrax, Sektor and Smoke, is that too much to ask for?"
See? He is a great addition. Never doubted for a second.
"Rambo actually looks really good. Lots of people saying he is a zoner,he looks like an all around character. I ain’t liking the crawl across the floor I ain’t gonna lie. I honestly don’t see much Kombo potential either tbh BUT I can’t wait to try him out."
Jesus! Rolling on the floor laughing love the fatality!
"This is so boring, this could've been another mk fighter but nooo it had to be Rambo"
He really just kill my baby
I’ll pass on the plain human with nothing special about them. But excited about rain and mileena! I guess you had to add one bad character to balance out those two
I really hope they fix mileenas face she looked so unfinished hopefully that’s why she’s last
Why couldn’t we get this Pensive face
It’s the lies for me
Somehow this games makes everything lame
"I really dnt care for the Mortal Kombat games, but if you like them then go ahead"
Why Rambo...
Let’s go!
Nice!
HIS GAMEPLAY IS SO SICK
